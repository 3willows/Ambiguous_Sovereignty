        The Limits of Law</h2>
    <div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec12-content">
        <p>Kant’s political sovereign carries a heavy burden of responsibility.<sup><a
                    href="./section_9.html#Fn104"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>104</a></sup> They are
            bound to make political judgments, but neither <i>a priori</i> principles, nor regents,
            judges, legal institutions nor positive law provide certain guidance. This is the limit of
            law in Kant’s political philosophy: Law can never fully subordinate political judgment. In
            this limit, Kant recognises that the force of empirical political circumstances on us finite
            beings mandates that judgment is exercised at every step in politics. However, he also holds
            that this judgment has a moral quality and a moral force. Prudent judgment is grounded not
            in instrumental reasoning, but in the obligation to maintain the state. Kant morally
            vindicates the role of prudence at the heart of his politics; exercised in accordance with
            rightful principle, prudence is not amoral or immoral, but is, to the contrary, deeply
            moral. This is what he means when he claims that a moral politician is ‘one who takes the
            principles of political prudence in such a way that they can coexist with morals’.<sup><a
                    href="./section_9.html#Fn105"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>105</a></sup> Rightful
            political judgment requires the sovereign as a moral politician to exercise political
            judgment to navigate the twin obligations to rule through rightful law-making and to
            maintain the necessity of the state. To emphasise the role of political judgment in Kant’s
            politics is not to dismiss the importance of moral judgment. It is rather to argue that
            there is a form of moral judgment distinctive to politics, and that the responsibility for
            this judgment falls on the sovereign above all.<sup><a href="./section_9.html#Fn106"><span
                        class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>106</a></sup></p>
        <p>To conclude this paper, I want to set out where my arguments leave me in relation to Kantian
            legalism and to the literature on Kant’s political philosophy more broadly. The active,
            political, prudential and judging Kantian sovereign I have argued for is in stark contrast
            to any legalist reading of the concept. As an interpretation of the ambiguity inherent in
            the notion of sovereignty, the political conception emphasises that, for Kant, establishing,
            maintaining and improving a rightful constitution in the world is not a legal project but a
            political one.<sup><a href="./section_9.html#Fn107"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                    </span>107</a></sup><i>The Doctrine of Right</i> is the key text for understanding
            how he understands right and law and, in the central concept of sovereignty, Kant grounds
            law on the political judgment of the sovereign. Political judgment is thus central to <i>The
                Doctrine of Right</i>, not the marginal concern it often appears to be in Kantian
            legalism.</p>
        <p>As well as this difference with Kantian legalism, my view also contrasts with approaches to
            political judgment in Kant which follow Hannah Arendt in drawing on material from Kant’s
            <i>Critique of the Power of Judgment</i>, and as well as from other of Kant’s political,
            anthological, or historical writings.<sup><a href="./section_9.html#Fn108"><span
                        class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                    </span>108</a></sup> A full picture of the
            role of political judgment in Kant’s political philosophy might well require these kinds of
            accounts. But my purpose here, and my challenge against the Kantian legalist, is to show
            that the principles derived in <i>The Doctrine of Right</i> itself, are principles of
            political judgment, not only of legal systems. It is not only in his historical,
            anthropological, and pedagogical writings, and well as other texts on politics, that
            judgment is key for Kant. Though these writings may take up the question of the refinement
            of political judgment, it is in <i>The Doctrine of Right</i> that the central importance of
            political judgment is established. By contrast with Arendt who declared Kant never wrote a
            political philosophy – a point Ronald Beiner refined by saying that, since Kant supposedly
            sees no place for prudence, he has no account of political judgment<sup><a
                    href="./section_9.html#Fn109"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>109</a></sup> – for
            Kant, as I read him, political judgment determines the relationship of law and politics. My
            claim thus does not amount to the well-established understanding that Kant thought that
            moral principles, such as those found in <i>The Doctrine of Right</i>, require
            supplementation by judgment, something that Kantian legalists are as clear about as any
            other group of interpreters.<sup><a href="./section_9.html#Fn110"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                    </span>110</a></sup> Rather my claim is that the moral principles of <i>The Doctrine
                of Right</i> should be understood as apt for judgment. That is, as principles of
            political judgment.
        </p>
        <p>Kant’s complex ideal of the ‘state in idea’ or <i>Rechtsstaat</i> arises from two
            obligations, to rule rightfully through law and to maintain the state, which can become
            contradictory under certain empirical circumstances. Whilst a legalist reading would attempt
            to resolve such a possible contradiction through the precise delineation of principles in
            philosophy, I have argued that Kant held that for this task the sovereign’s practical
            political judgment is central. Thus, contrary to Kantian legalism, politics is not
            subordinated to law, rather law depends on political judgment. The task of politics is not
            only to apply law in particular circumstances; the task of politics judge what is necessary
            to secure the conditions in which a legal system, grounded on <i>a priori</i> principles,
            could exist.</p>
        <p>As Kant puts it in his reply to criticism from Benjamin Constant, politics is a problem, the
            problem of how to arrange society in accordance with freedom and equality.<sup><a
                    href="./section_9.html#Fn111"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>111</a></sup> It is a
            problem finite human beings face, perhaps perpetually, and that requires judgment, not only
            law and principles, to manage successfully. It is this thought of Kant’s, though not
            necessarily ‘Kantian’ thought, that I have tried to understand in this paper, a task which
            legalistic readings have not undertaken. I don’t claim to have decisively refuted such
            readings, only suggested that another kind of interpretation is possible, one embraces the
            active ambiguity in Kant’s conception of sovereignty as being the result of the practical
            and political perspective from which he wrote and judged.</p>
