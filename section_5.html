                Hierarchy of Authorities</h2>

<div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec9-content">
<p>As well as a separation of the three authorities, Kant also establishes a hierarchy of the
                    three authorities with the sovereign at the top. Beyond the direct functions of the state
                    authorities with regard to the establishment of law, the sovereign legislature holds powers
                    over the other two authorities which are not matched with symmetrical powers. This creates a
                    hierarchy, not equality, between the three separate authorities. Consider the following
                    passage, which I referenced in extract above:</p>
<blockquote class="c-blockquote">
<div class="c-blockquote__body">
<p><i>The sovereign can also take the regent’s authority away from him, depose him, or
                                reform his administration. But it cannot punish him (and the saying common in
                                England, that the king i.e. the supreme executive authority, can do no wrong,
                                means no more than this); for punishment is, again, an act of executive
                                authority, which has the supreme capacity to exercise coercion in conformity
                                with the law, and it would be self-contradictory for him to be subject to
                                coercion.</i><sup><a href="#Fn54"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                                    </span>54</a></sup></p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The first sentence shows that the sovereign has authority over the regent – i.e. the person
                    who holds executive authority – in a right to remove, depose or reform them. The sovereign
                    legislature’s authority here does not manifest in a right to exercise executive authority
                    against the regent, but to strip their authority rendering them no more than a private
                    citizen.<sup><a href="#Fn55"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>55</a></sup>
                    The sovereign has the authority to decide who can exercise executive authority and, to that
                    extent, how they exercise it.</p>
<p><i>The Doctrine of Right</i> also gives the sovereign legislature authority over the judge or
                    judicial authority. First, the sovereign has power of appointment of judges: ‘neither the
                    head of state nor regent can judge, but can only appoint judges as magistrates’.<sup><a href="#Fn56"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>56</a></sup> Second, in
                    certain circumstances or ‘cases of necessity’ the sovereign has the power to ‘assume the
                    role of judge’ and decree a different sentence to that pronounced by the judge.<sup><a href="#Fn57"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>57</a></sup> Finally,
                    the sovereign also has the right to grant clemency of which Kant says: ‘This right is the
                    only one that deserves to be called the right of majesty’.<sup><a href="#Fn58"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>58</a></sup> The right of clemency is
                    limited. Firstly, it is restricted to cases of ‘wrongs done to himself’ i.e., to the
                    sovereign, and never ‘crimes of <i>subjects</i> against one another’.<sup><a href="#Fn59"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>59</a></sup> One
                    plausible interpretation of this restriction is that the right of clemency only applies in
                    the case of a crime against the state, not a private person, or crimes of public law, and
                    not private law. Secondly, even then the right of clemency may not be invoked if it ‘could
                    endanger the people’s security’.<sup><a href="#Fn60"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>60</a></sup> Nonetheless, the right of
                    clemency is a second right of the sovereign legislature to annul the verdict of the judge.
                    There are no symmetrical powers for the judge over the sovereign legislature. Nor are there
                    such powers for the regent.</p>
<p>Kant has a principled reason for endorsing this hierarchy of authorities as well as the
                    separation of authorities. This is the necessity of the state as the condition for possible
                    law-making. To see why this is the case, it will be helpful to consider the example of
                    Kant’s ‘population-wide murder conspiracy’, before moving on to the justification in
                    general.<sup><a href="#Fn61"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>61</a></sup> It
                    is worth quoting in full:</p>
<blockquote class="c-blockquote">
<div class="c-blockquote__body">
<p><i>Accordingly, every murderer – anyone who commits murder, orders it, or is an
                                accomplice in it – must suffer death; this is what justice, as the idea of
                                judicial authority, wills in accordance with universal laws that are grounded a
                                priori. – If, however, the number of accomplices is so great that the state, in
                                order to have no such criminals in it, could soon find itself without subjects;
                                and if the state still does not want to dissolve, that is, to pass over into a
                                state of nature, which is far worse because there is no external justice at all
                                in it (and if it especially does not want to dull the people’s feeling by the
                                spectacle of a slaughterhouse), then the sovereign must also have it in his
                                power, in this case of necessity (casus necessitatis), to assume the role of
                                judge (to represent him) and pronounce a judgment that decrees for the criminals
                                a sentence other than capital punishment, such as deportation, which still
                                preserves the population. This cannot be done in accordance with public law but
                                it can be done by executive decree</i> [Machtspruch] <i>that is, by an act of
                                the right of majesty, which as clemency, can always be exercised only in
                                individual cases.</i><sup><a href="#Fn62"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote

<p>
                    In this case, the judge is confronted by a murder conspiracy encompassing the whole, or
                    nearly whole, population. By law the rightful judgment is to execute each of the citizens.
                    The reason for this is that for the crime of murder, no punishment is adequate but that the
                    perpetrator die.<sup><a href="#Fn63"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>63</a></sup> Earlier in the section from which this passage is taken, Kant
                    also states that the law of punishment in general is a categorical imperative.<sup><a href="#Fn64"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>64</a></sup> So it is
                    not only that by positive, or what Kant calls subjective, law that the judge ought to
                    pronounce this verdict, but by objective law, grounded <i>a priori</i> and established by
                    the sovereign legislature.<sup><a href="#Fn65"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>65</a></sup> Following this, the executive regent ought to carry out the
                    executions. This course of action would be the three authorities performing their respective
                    functions in accordance with the separation of authorities. The sovereign establishes the
                    lawful punishment for murder in accordance with <i>a priori</i> principles; the judge
                    applies the law through their verdict; and the executive regent carries out the extreme
                    coercive function of executing the entire population. Yet Kant still holds that the
                    sovereign must intervene via a ‘Machtspruch’ to prevent this from happening. How can this be
                    justified and made compatible with the justification for the separation of authorities?</p>
<p>The key is to see how the sovereign still represents the omnilateral will throughout this
                    case. Kant’s reasoning is that carrying out the original verdict would lead to the risk that
                    the state would ‘pass over into the state of nature, which is far worse because there is no
                    external justice at all’. In the unlikely empirical circumstances Kant imagines, the
                    normally desirable fact that the particular willing of the regent and the judge cannot be
                    directed at anything other than applying a general law in a particular case has created a
                    situation in which the state, lawfully and rightfully, might rule itself out of existence,
                    thus destroying any possibility of rightful lawgiving. Without population there cannot be a
                    state and without a state there cannot be rightful laws. The judge’s particular will is
                    constrained by omnilateral law to will the destruction of the conditions that make such
                    willing possible: But this is a contradiction in willing. For this reason, the sovereign
                    acts in a particular case whilst still representing the omnilateral will because that act
                    secures the conditions for the possibility of the omnnilateral willing of rightful laws. The
                    sovereign assumes the role of the judge, exercises their authority to pronounce a sentence
                    that maintains the population, such as deportation to another province, and carries it out
                    through executive decree. The separation of authorities is violated, but the sovereign does
                    not act from their particular will, and so is rightful and justified in doing so.</p>
<p>The population-wide murder conspiracy is not the only place in which Kant explicitly makes
                    clear his commitment to justifying the sovereign’s right to maintain the existence of the
                    state. Kant also argues that the sovereign, in addition to rights of taxation, may further
                    levy forced loans, even in cases where that deviates ‘from previously existing law’ when
                    ‘the state is in danger of dissolution’.<sup><a href="#Fn66"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>66</a></sup> In a similar vein, Kant’s
                    justification of the right of the state to tax where it is necessary to maintain ‘the
                    <i>poor</i>, <i>foundling homes</i> and <i>church organizations</i>’ is based on his view
                    that ‘The general will of the people has united itself into a society which is to
                    <i>maintain itself perpetually</i>; and for this end it has submitted itself to the internal
                    authority of the state in order to maintain those members of the society who are unable to
                    maintain themselves’.<sup><a href="#Fn67"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>67</a></sup> Beyond <i>The Doctrine of Right</i>, in <i>Toward Perpetual
                        Peace</i>, Kant discusses the possibility of permissive laws that allow the sovereign to
                    postpone putting laws into effect lest that see the state ‘devoured by other states’.<sup><a href="#Fn68"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>68</a></sup> Again,
                    Kant justifies the sovereign acting in defence of the state. This indicates that, although
                    the population-wide murder conspiracy is an incredibly unlikely and exceptional
                    circumstance, this authority of sovereign is invoked in the normal course of
                    politics.<sup><a href="#Fn69"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>69</a></sup>
                    However, the population-wide murder conspiracy is the most important example in the present
                    context because it is in that case that Kant says explicitly that the sovereign is justified
                    in violating the law and the separation of authorities in order to maintain the state.
                </p>
<p>This line of reasoning can be expanded to cover the other cases in which the sovereign
                    violates the separation of authorities and thus justifies the hierarchy overall. The
                    sovereign intervenes on the executive and judicial authorities when doing so is necessary
                    for maintaining the state, as the condition which makes rightful lawgiving possible, under
                    empirical conditions that may not always be favourable to this. For example, the authority
                    to strip the regent of executive authority means that should the regent, who is of course a
                    finite human being and therefore fallible, begin to threaten the state, then the sovereign
                    is able to rightfully intervene. Therefore, the sovereign’s authority allows them to
                    maintain the state in cases where the application of law through separated authorities is
                    not sufficient to the task, or even where the application of the law itself is the source of
                    the threat.</p>
