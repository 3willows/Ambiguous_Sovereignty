                Political Judgment and the Ideal Legal System</h2>

<div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec11-content">
<p>Once we have the <i>political</i> quality of Kant’s concept of sovereignty in view, the
                    ambiguity in sovereignty eventually resolves into a contradiction between two obligations on
                    the sovereign, which is itself resolved through the political judgment of the sovereign. One
                    might say that this amounts to clearing up the ambiguity and restoring consistency to Kant.
                    In one sense, this is correct. In so far as Kant’s political philosophy should enable us to
                    make consistent political judgments, the ambiguity is not problematic. But if the text is
                    supposed to be the blueprint for an ideal legal state or system of law as Kantian legalists
                    would have it, then the ambiguity still presents a problem. Kant does not define the
                    circumstances in which sovereign judgment may subordinate the ordinary processes of rightful
                    law and the separation of authorities, he leaves it to the judgment of the sovereign. We
                    might be able to say that if the sovereign is wrong about whether there is a threat to the
                    state, then they have exercised judgment poorly. We might also be able to say that if the
                    sovereign is not acting in good faith and is using the threat to the state as a pretext for
                    usurping other authorities, then this is wrong. But in both cases, what we don’t have is a
                    set of conditions and circumstances by which the rightfulness is to be judged without either
                    relying on empirical judgment about how bad a threat to the state is, or on suppositions
                    about what the sovereign is really thinking.</p>
<p>Kantian legalism favours a discourse of legal precision, set categories, and fine
                    distinctions, and I suspect would reject this tolerance of the ambiguity inherent in
                    political sovereignty.<sup><a href="#Fn89"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>89</a></sup> More importantly, however, the interpretation I have given
                    suggests that Kant’s political principles are principles of political judgment, not
                    principles of ideal legal systems or even of legal judgments. This is the core of my
                    challenge to Kantian legalism. Whilst it would be wrong to say of <i>The Doctrine of
                        Right</i>, and Kant’s political philosophy in general, that it is not concerned with the
                    elaboration and justification of a system of <i>a priori</i> legal principles which are to
                    serve as the normative ideal for all positive legal systems, my point is that it is
                    concerned with much more besides. <i>The Doctrine of Right</i> is a system of external
                    duties that concern interaction between agents from which all rights derive.<sup><a href="#Fn90"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>90</a></sup> Such
                    external duties are not exhausted by those <i>a priori</i> legal principles that ground a
                    system of law but concern all external duties including those that cannot be captured within
                    a legal system. This renders <i>The Doctrine of Right</i> an inherently <i>political</i>
                    text; it aims to orientate the agent in a world shared with others by establishing grounds
                    for external duties and principles for practical judgment.<sup><a href="#Fn91"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>91</a></sup><i>The Doctrine of
                        Right</i> is thus best understood as offering a sustained attempt at political and
                    practical reasoning of which the ambiguous concept of political sovereignty is, I suggest, a
                    key part. Kant’s aim is not legal precision, but principles that guide the judgment of
                    political agents. In Kant’s practical reasoning in <i>The Doctrine of Right</i> the
                    perspective of the finite, which is to say the human, judging agent is never lost. If
                    sovereignty is political, ambiguous, and active, rather than legal, precise, and static,
                    then it is not possible to eliminate judgment from our politics. Nor is it (always) possible
                    to constrain it through law. Judgment is needed at each stage of political thinking and
                    acting, never allowing us to rest assured that law grounded on <i>a priori</i> principles
                    justifies everything we do. The political sovereign is active within the Kantian state and
                    must exercise judgment in contending with all the vagaries of empirical political
                    circumstance.</p>
<p>There are no explicit conditions that could frame a constitutional provision determining when
                    the sovereign exercises their judgment, because the framing of such an ideal constitution is
                    not Kant’s primary concern. Indeed, the means by which he could do this are ruled out. As we
                    have already seen, positive law (constitutional or otherwise) does not constrain the
                    sovereign’s judgment. Recall that Kant claims that the sovereign’s usurpation of the judge
                    in population-wide murder conspiracy case ‘cannot be done in accordance with public
                    law’.<sup><a href="#Fn92"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>92</a></sup> This
                    is an explicit statement that when the sovereign usurps the role of the judge, the sovereign
                    does not act through law by changing it or introducing a loophole. It is perhaps because
                    Kant invokes ‘justice, as the idea of judicial authority’ as the grounds for his policy of
                    an-eye-for-an-eye that such legal solutions are unacceptable in this case.<sup><a href="#Fn93"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>93</a></sup> This is
                    all the more likely if we also accept my earlier characterisation of this law of punishment
                    as objective law. Kant instead turns to a different solution, one that takes us beyond the
                    law, to a ‘Machtspruch’ or executive decree.<sup><a href="#Fn94"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>94</a></sup> As we saw in Section <a data-track="click" data-track-action="section anchor" data-track-label="link" href="/article/10.1007/s10982-023-09486-w#Sec9">IV</a>, this also applies to other cases
                    in which Kant argues for the sovereign to act extra-legally in defence of the existence of
                    the state, such as that of forced loans, or in violation of the separation of authorities,
                    such as deposing the regent. We might add to this last point that Kant’s rejection of ‘mixed
                    constitutions’ and his claim that a ‘moderate constitution, as a constitution of the inner
                    rights of a state, is an absurdity’ show that he is also not concerned with other legal
                    institutions constraining the sovereign’s judgment.<sup><a href="#Fn95"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>95</a></sup> The other authorities do
                    not hold rightful authority over the sovereign and so cannot constrain the sovereign’s
                    judgment.</p>
<p>The core difference between the reading of <i>The Doctrine of Right</i> presented here
                    and that of Kantian legalists, is the claim that Kant’s primary concern is not framing the
                    ideal constitution because his political principles are principles of political judgment not
                    of ideal legal systems. I am not arguing that an ideal legal system is unimportant for Kant.
                    Indeed, the necessity of creating and maintaining a system of law is Kant’s justification
                    for the separation of authorities. Moreover, I also accept that ideals play a key role in
                    Kant’s political philosophy. Nor am I claiming that Kantian legalism sees no place for
                    political judgment.<sup><a href="#Fn96"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>96</a></sup> Instead, I am making a claim about the relationship of this
                    ideal of a legal system to political judgment. For Kantian legalists, political judgment is
                    legal in the sense that it is constrained within the established legal order. State
                    authorities are empowered by law to make judgments that would otherwise be wrongful. This
                    leaves open the matter of the political judgments reached by different state authorities,
                    but it requires that these judgments be grounded in law or given expression through law. It
                    is this understanding of political judgment in Kant that I reject. Political judgment in
                    Kant is not constrained by the ideal legal system, but rather the latter depends on the
                    former. The sovereign’s judgment is political.<sup><a href="#Fn97"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>97</a></sup> It is, as Kant terms it
                    in the population-wide murder conspiracy example, a ‘Machtspruch’. It is an exercise of
                    power, unconstrained by law upon which the possibility of the legal system and of rightful
                    law-making depends.</p>
<p>Kant’s ideal legal system or the ideal ‘state in idea’ is then a regulative ideal that
                    orientates for the sake of practical action.<sup><a href="#Fn98"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>98</a></sup> Ideals in Kant’s
                    practical philosophy are the realisation of ideas of reason. A useful example of what this
                    means can be found the <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i> where Kant says that the idea of
                    wisdom has as its counterpart ideal the perfectly wise person or sage.<sup><a href="#Fn99"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>99</a></sup> An ideal
                    is an individual thing entirely determined by the idea. Whether this is the ideal sage by
                    the idea of wisdom, or the ideal legal system by the idea of rightful law. Such ideals are
                    impossible for us to realise, but they serve to orientate the action of practical moral
                    agents.<sup><a href="#Fn100"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>100</a></sup>
                    Thus in so far as wisdom is a virtue, we ought to strive to realise sagacity in our own
                    person, even though being perfectly wise is impossible. The same is true of Kant’s ideal
                    legal system in so far as the sovereign ought to rule through rightful law, with the
                    attendant separation of authorities, so they are constrained by the idea of law in the form
                    of an obligation. But for this argument to support a legalistic constraint on judgment it
                    would require that this idea of law must be decisive in the sovereign’s judgment. Political
                    judgment must be made the mere application of the idea of law to empirical circumstances.
                </p>
<p>However, we have already seen that the sovereign is also under an obligation to maintain the
                    state. Moreover, we have seen that this obligation is grounded in Kant’s ideal ‘state in
                    idea’. The ideal is thus complex and arises from to two imperatives, both binding on the
                    sovereign, that are not inherently contradictory but might become so under particular
                    empirical circumstances. Put another way, the sovereign is stuck between two orientations.
                    Again, think of the population-wide murder conspiracy. It is only under the empirical
                    circumstances in which there is such an enormous conspiracy that the sovereign is forced
                    into a judgment between two obligations. The first is to allow the verdict to go ahead in
                    accordance with objectively rightful law, the second is to usurp the function of the judge
                    in order to maintain the state. Faced with this dilemma, the <i>a priori</i> idea of
                    rightful law cannot be decisive in the sovereign’s judgment since there is nothing <i>a
                        priori</i> that allows for a judgment between the two obligations.</p>
<p>This dilemma is a conflict of duties. Strictly speaking, Kant denies that a true conflict of
                    duties is possible, but in the introduction to <i>The Metaphysics of Morals</i> he discusses
                    the potential for conflicts in what he calls the grounds of obligation.<sup><a href="#Fn101"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>101</a></sup>
                    Following Jens Timmermann’s analysis, such grounds of obligation are best conceived of as
                    pro tanto duties which can be defeated by other grounds of obligation judged to be
                    stronger.<sup><a href="#Fn102"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>102</a></sup>
                    To find the stronger ground of obligation, the judger cannot simply look to <i>a priori</i>
                    principles, but must judge according to the moral conditions of their experiential
                    circumstances. This is a moral judgment that can only be made by the judging agent in the
                    conditions they find themselves. The conflict ‘arises in moral practice’.<sup><a href="#Fn103"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>103</a></sup> Applying
                    this idea to the case of the sovereign exercising political judgment, the sovereign must
                    judge which of the grounds of obligation – the idea of rightful law, or the maintenance of
                    the state – is stronger in the circumstances of their moral practice. In this political
                    instance of a conflict of duties, the sovereign will have to make a kind of prudential
                    judgment: Will ruling rightfully, through the law and the separation of authorities,
                    threaten the state? In the case of the population-wide murder conspiracy the answer is
                    clear, it will do so and so the ground of obligation to maintain the state is stronger. In
                    other cases, the answer won’t be so clear, and the sovereign may have to accept some risk to
                    the state in order to rule rightfully.</p>
<p>The ideal legal state thus cannot provide definitive orientation to political judgment, and
                    nor can the idea of law itself be decisive. Kant’s ideal for the legal state is part of his
                    practical reasoning in <i>The Doctrine of Right</i>, but it is not his only focus. His focus
                    is on the rightfulness of political judgment, and the principles that guide it. He finds
                    that the application of law, and the formulation of a legal ideal is not sufficient for this
                    task. The picture of moral and political judgment that emerges in Kant is a good deal more
                    complicated than that.</p>
