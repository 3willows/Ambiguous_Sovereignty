                Kantian Legalism</h2>

<div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec2-content">
<p>Legalism is an approach to political and legal philosophy characterised by the subordination
                    of politics to law.<sup><a href="#Fn5"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>5</a></sup> Political problems are resolved by subjecting them to legal
                    processes, and rightful political action takes place within the constraints of law. More
                    than this, the idea is that rightful political action, especially state action and power,
                    ought to be exercised through law and legal processes. I introduce and use the term ‘Kantian
                    legalism’ here to refer to readings of Kant’s political philosophy, especially in <i>The
                        Doctrine of Right</i>, along these lines.<sup><a href="#Fn6"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>6</a></sup> These have become
                    especially influential within Kant scholarship in the last decade.<sup><a href="#Fn7"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>7</a></sup></p>
<p>Kantian legalists differ on the details, but they all agree that, for Kant, the freedom and
                    equality of all citizens is realised through law and the legal state; the
                    <i>Rechtsstaat</i>. The freedom and equality of citizens cannot be achieved in the state of
                    nature. This is because in the state of nature the relations between individuals are in some
                    way problematically unilateral when it comes to rights claims such as property and contract.
                    The thought is that if individuals are free and equal, then there is a problem to explain
                    how the ability of any individual to place others under obligations through rights claims
                    (such as to not interfere with an object by claiming that object as my property) can be
                    compatible with the equal freedom of all. The solution to this is law grounded on the
                    omnilateral or general united will. The sovereign of the legal state represents this will
                    while making laws and thus the law is not unilateral, and the law can then underly the
                    actions of individuals. The state is structured to achieve this end which Kant calls a
                    rightful condition. As Thomas Sinclair puts it: ‘The most important means by which this is
                    achieved is that there exist legislative, judicial, and executive roles in the Kantian state
                    that are defined by obligations to create and sustain through law a rightful
                    condition’.<sup><a href="#Fn8"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>8</a></sup>
                    It is thus law and legal processes which secure the freedom and equality of citizens
                    according to Kantian legalism. The effect of this on politics is to subordinate it to law.
                    Free relations between individuals are guaranteed only insofar as politics is subjected to
                    legal processes which are omnilaterally legitimated.
                </p>
<p>Kantian legalism thus contains substantive commitments, such as to the rule of law. But it is
                    also a philosophical approach that holds a particular view about the purpose of Kant’s
                    political and legal philosophy. Kantian legalism holds that the principles Kant derives are
                    not only realised through law, but that Kantian political principles <i>are</i> the
                    principles of legal systems. <i>The Doctrine of Right</i> is taken to be the elaboration of
                    the philosophical principles that comprise the ideal legal system that would fully realise
                    freedom and equality. The task of politics is to apply these <i>a priori</i> principles in
                    the real world and, when this is done, we achieve a rightful condition. Importantly,
                    rightful politics then becomes a matter of specifying these <i>a priori</i> principles in
                    practice by making law, and all other political action needs to take place within the
                    constraints of this law. Rightful politics becomes a fundamentally legal matter.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, then, law is central to Kantian legalism, but what of political judgment? I
                    have signalled that my challenge to Kantian legalism will be to stress the relative
                    importance of political judgment as against that of law in <i>The Doctrine of Right</i>, so
                    what does Kantian legalism say about judgment? As I see it, judgment has three roles within
                    Kantian legalism but each of these roles shares a common dependence upon the existence of a
                    legal order, in virtue of which each of these kinds of judgment might be described as legal
                    and not political. The first role of judgment is as verdict: The decision of a court is ‘a
                    <i>judgment</i>’.<sup><a href="#Fn9"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>9</a></sup> Verdict is the judgment, ‘an individual act of public justice’,
                    by which the judge applies positive law in a particular case.<sup><a href="#Fn10"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>10</a></sup> That is, the verdict of a
                    judge resolves Kant’s practical syllogism: ‘These are like the three propositions in a
                    practical syllogism: the major premise, which contains the law of that will; the minor
                    premise, which contains the command to behave in accordance with the law, that is, the
                    principle of subsumption under the law; and the conclusion, which contains the verdict
                    (sentence), what is laid down as right in the case at hand’.<sup><a href="#Fn11"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>11</a></sup>
</p>
<p>Verdict is perhaps the paradigmatic example of legal judgment, but the second role for
                    judgment in Kantian legalism is administrative judgment. State officials are able to make
                    judgments that individuals would not because they hold a legally defined public office that
                    authorises them to make certain judgments. As the office is legally defined and the law is
                    conceived as omnilateral, what would be problematically unilateral for the private person to
                    do is not problematic for the public office holder.<sup><a href="#Fn12"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>12</a></sup> The final and third role
                    for judgment in Kantian legalism is legislative judgment. This is the kind of judgment
                    involved in omnilateral public law-making, in which <i>a priori</i> principles of law are
                    specified in positive legislation.</p>
<p>Each of these roles for judgment is premised on the legal order. That is, they are judgments
                    that take place within established institutional and legal constraints – principally the
                    separation of authorities. The judge only passes verdict on laws passed by the legislature,
                    state officials only judge within the constraints of their offices as defined in law by the
                    legislature, and the legislature does no more than pass law as one of three state
                    authorities. Rightful political judgment is, in this sense, legal judgment according to
                    Kantian legalism. Every political judgment can be given effect through law because rightful
                    political judgment always operates within the legal order of the <i>Rechsstaat</i>.<sup><a href="#Fn13"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>13</a></sup> It is this
                    feature of Kantian legalism which my argument is intended to challenge. Rightful political
                    judgment need not be given effect through law, nor operate within the legal order on my
                    reading of <i>The Doctrine of Right</i>. In particular, the rightful political judgment of
                    the sovereign need not be legal. Indeed, the legal order itself depends on the sovereign’s
                    political judgment, not the other way around.</p>
