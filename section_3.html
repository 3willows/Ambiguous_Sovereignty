<h2>
                Ambiguous Sovereignty</h2>

<div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec3-content">
<p>In order to see the important role of political judgment in <i>The Doctrine of Right</i>, we
                    need to look carefully at the role of the sovereign. There is a core and systematic
                    ambiguity in Kant’s concept sovereignty which can best be understood as being resolved by
                    political judgment and in relation to a political conception of sovereignty, not through
                    legal judgment and a legal conception. Now, to say that there are ambiguities in the concept
                    of sovereignty would not strike political philosophers as being anything new.<sup><a href="#Fn14"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>14</a></sup> The most
                    frequently discussed ambiguities in the notion of sovereignty involve either the relation of
                    the state to the sovereign, or that of the people to the sovereign state, and one finds
                    these in <i>The Doctrine of Right</i> too.<sup><a href="#Fn15"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>15</a></sup> But there is a different
                    ambiguity in Kant that relates to the relationship of law and politics, and it concerns the
                    scope of the sovereign’s authority in relation to the other authorities of the state.<sup><a href="#Fn16"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>16</a></sup></p>
<h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec4">The Three Authorities</h3>
<p>As noted above, Kant distinguishes three state authorities – sovereign or legislative,
                    executive and judicial – and three persons who each hold one of these authorities –
                    sovereign or legislator, regent and judge. Each authority has different powers in the
                    Kantian state. Sovereign authority gives general or universal laws for the state.<sup><a href="#Fn17"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>17</a></sup> The laws
                    are ‘the same (…) for all and all for each’ meaning that the laws are given by all (united)
                    and to all (general). For this reason, sovereign authority belongs to the general united
                    will of the people, though vested in the person of the legislator.<sup><a href="#Fn18"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>18</a></sup> The executive authority
                    provides coercive physical power and other incentives to enforce the laws. It is held by the
                    person of the regent, who is also called the governor, the directorate or government.<sup><a href="#Fn19"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>19</a></sup> The regent
                    provides directives and decrees, not laws, and governs the state. The regent is the only
                    authority which can exercise coercion and punish, but, as an agent of the state, they are
                    subject to the laws of the sovereign.<sup><a href="#Fn20"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>20</a></sup> The judicial authority
                    provides verdicts on applications of the law to particular cases. As with the executive
                    authority, the judicial authority is constrained by the laws of the sovereign and may not
                    deviate from them.<sup><a href="#Fn21"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>21</a></sup> These three authorities are essential for the establishment of a
                    state and are ‘dignities’, meaning they are ‘eminent estates without pay’ or what we could
                    call political or civil statuses.<sup><a href="#Fn22"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>22</a></sup></p>
<h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec5">Sovereignty as Public Authority</h3>
<p>Kant’s discussion of the three authorities has been noted for its obscurity.<sup><a href="#Fn23"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>23</a></sup> One reason
                    for this may be that when considered in relation to these three authorities of the state,
                    Kant’s concept of sovereignty appears to be ambiguous between two conceptions. The first is
                    the conception of <i>sovereignty as public authority</i>, which refers to the three
                    authorities of the state taken together:</p>
<blockquote class="c-blockquote">
<div class="c-blockquote__body">
<p><i>The three authorities in a state, which arise from the concept of a commonwealth
                                as such (res publica latius dicta), are only the three relations of the united
                                will of the people, which is derived a priori from reason. They are a pure idea
                                of a head of state, which has objective practical reality. But this head of
                                state (the sovereign) is only a thought-entity (to represent the entire people)
                                as long as there is no physical person to represent the supreme authority in the
                                state and to make this idea effective on the people’s will.</i><sup><a href="#Fn24"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>24</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>
                    In this passage, the sovereign – as a thought entity – represents the people as united in a
                    commonwealth and so contains within it the three authorities.<sup><a href="#Fn25"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>25</a></sup> This thought entity is
                    then represented by a physical person, the sovereign, and so this physical person also
                    represents public authority in general. This person, Kant goes on to say, could be an
                    autocrat, or an aristocratic or democratic assembly.<sup><a href="#Fn26"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>26</a></sup></p>
<h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec6">Sovereignty as Legislature</h3>
<p>The second, opposing, conception of sovereignty is <i>sovereignty as legislature</i>. Instead
                    of conceiving of sovereignty as containing all three authorities, this conception conceives
                    of sovereignty as only one of the authorities: ‘the sovereign authority (sovereignty) in the
                    person of the legislator’.<sup><a href="#Fn27"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>27</a></sup> This sovereign authority only has part of the authority of the
                    state, that of legislation. As a consequence, Kant describes the sovereign as interacting
                    with the other state authorities: ‘The sovereign may take the regent’s authority away from
                    him…’ and ‘the sovereign must also have in his power, in this case of necessity (<i>casus
                        necessitatis</i>), to assume to role of the judge (to represent him) and pronounce a
                    judgment…’<sup><a href="#Fn28"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>28</a></sup>
                    This sovereign holds not public authority <i>in general</i> but only one part of public
                    authority, that of <i>legislation</i>.<sup><a href="#Fn29"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>29</a></sup></p>
<h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec7">Ambiguous Sovereignty in Kantian Legalism</h3>
<p>This ambiguity between <i>sovereignty as public authority</i> and <i>sovereignty as
                        legislature</i> is carried over into Kantian legalism. I say ‘carried over’ because it
                    is not actively theorised by Kantian legalists, but nonetheless remains present in their
                    texts. Jacob Weinrib is an exception in noting the ambiguity, but his purposes lead him away
                    from discussing it further.<sup><a href="#Fn30"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>30</a></sup> More often the ambiguity is carried over without comment. As an
                    example, Ripstein states that ‘the three branches: legislature, executive and judiciary.
                    Together, they comprise the sovereign’.<sup><a href="#Fn31"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>31</a></sup> Yet he also writes ‘the
                    sovereign (legislature) also has the power to tax and to spend monies on the creation of
                    public spaces…’<sup><a href="#Fn32"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>32</a></sup> I suspect the ambiguity is untheorized simply because the
                    legalist approach calls for precise definition and delineation of important concepts, and
                    Kant’s imprecision on this point can be chalked up to poor drafting, his self-confessed
                    rushed exposition, or <i>The Doctrine of Right’s</i> troubled publication history.<sup><a href="#Fn33"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>33</a></sup> Yet it is
                    because I noticed that this ambiguity is carried over, even into the very phrasing and
                    formulation of these texts, that I first began to suspect it had systematic importance.</p>
<p>If confronted by the ambiguity, however, a Kantian legalist might attempt to argue that with
                    a more precise delineation of terms the ambiguity could be eliminated. There are two
                    approaches that are most promising for this task, but neither is successful. The first is to
                    draw on the distinction between a public office and the person who holds it, as discussed in
                    Section <a data-track="click" data-track-action="section anchor" data-track-label="link" href="/article/10.1007/s10982-023-09486-w#Sec2">I</a> in the context of administrative
                    judgment. Using this distinction, one could argue that there is no ambiguity in Kant’s
                    concept of sovereignty, it is just that Kant sometimes refers to the office and at others to
                    the person. However, the ambiguity transcends this distinction. I have highlighted above how
                    when conceiving of sovereignty as public authority, the sovereign is a thought entity that
                    comprises the three authorities taken together which is itself represented by a physical
                    person. By contrast, when sovereignty is conceived as legislature, the sovereign authority
                    as an office is represented in the person of the sovereign (legislator). In other words,
                    Kant conceives of both sovereignty as public authority and sovereignty as legislature as
                    both an office and a person and so the ambiguity remains.<sup><a href="#Fn34"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>34</a></sup></p>
<p>The second approach is to argue that the concept of representation can be invoked to defuse
                    the ambiguity.<sup><a href="#Fn35"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>35</a></sup> As again discussed in Section <a data-track="click" data-track-action="section anchor" data-track-label="link" href="/article/10.1007/s10982-023-09486-w#Sec2">I</a>, for Kant and for Kantian
                    legalists, the sovereign represents the general united or omnilateral will. One might think
                    there is some way to explain the ambiguity away by these means. One might think, for
                    example, that because the sovereign as legislature is closely connected to the general
                    united will, that this is what needs to be represented by a physical person, and this
                    physical person is the sovereign as public authority; however, this would be to miss the
                    point. The question is, what is the idea or thought entity of sovereignty that is
                    represented? Is it the conception as one legislative authority, or the conception of three
                    public authorities together?</p>
