<p>Kantian legalism is now the dominant scholarly interpretation of Kant and an important approach
                to legal and political philosophy in its own right. One notable feature is its construal of the
                relationship between law and politics decisively in law’s favour: Law subordinates politics.
                Political judgment is constrained by and only permissibly exercised through law. This paper
                opposes this subordination through a close analysis of an ambiguity in Kant’s conception of
                sovereignty. Understanding this ambiguity requires seeing that, for Kant, law cannot subordinate
                the sovereign’s political judgment because it is a condition which makes a legal system
                possible. Kant was not an exacting legalist, but a practical reasoner struggling with the
                pressures politics imposes on finite beings. Through discussion of a leading contemporary
                approach, and close engagement with its historical source, the paper raises new considerations
                about the relevance of political judgment in the relationship of law and politics.</p>
