                Political Sovereignty</h2>
        <div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec10-content">
                <p>The hierarchy of authorities thus rests on the principled need to maintain the existence of
                        the state as the condition of possible law-making. But how are we to understand this
                        principle and in turn understand the nature of sovereignty in <i>The Doctrine of Right</i>?
                        In the literature, the hierarchy of authorities, and therefore sovereignty, is most often
                        understood in legal terms, but this approach runs into problems. Byrd and Hruschka argue the
                        sovereign is “‘higher’ than both the highest executive and the highest judge and thus stands
                        <i>above</i> them, because the second and third powers are <i>subject to</i>, or
                        <i>under</i> the law”.<sup><a href="./section_9.html#Fn70"><span
                                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                                        </span>70</a></sup> This is true, but it does not seem to me to account for the
                        features of the hierarchy as just described. The fact that executive and judicial authority
                        must be exercised in accordance with law seems to be more of an expression of the separation
                        of authorities with regard to law-making than an account of the hierarchy. The subordination
                        of the regent and judge to law is perfectly compatible with the three authorities being
                        ‘coordinate and subordinate’.<sup><a href="./section_9.html#Fn71"><span
                                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                                        </span>71</a></sup> That describes the separation of authority with regard to
                        law-making, rather than the hierarchy of authorities. Indeed, in the passage cited by Byrd
                        and Hruschka in support of this understanding of the hierarchy, Kant does say ‘the regent is
                        subject to the law’.<sup><a href="./section_9.html#Fn72"><span
                                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                                        </span>72</a></sup> However, he also says ‘The sovereign can <i>also</i> take
                        the
                        ruler’s authority away’ indicating that the authority of the sovereign over the regent
                        consists in more than the subordination of executive authority to law.<sup><a
                                        href="./section_9.html#Fn73"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                                        </span>73</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>Ripstein also argues that ‘the legislative will takes priority’ because ‘the exercise of
                        judgment and the enforcement of rights’ by the judge and regent respectively ‘must be done
                        in accordance with law’.<sup><a href="./section_9.html#Fn74"><span
                                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                                        </span>74</a></sup> But he goes further to argue that ‘The only way a judge or
                        enforcer can be empowered consistent with right is through an act of legislative
                        will’.<sup><a href="./section_9.html#Fn75"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                                        </span>75</a></sup> This
                        is suggestive that not only is the sovereign higher because the powers of the regent and
                        judge must be exercised under law, but the hierarchy also consists in the power of the
                        sovereign to appoint the regent and the judge through legal means. This, I think, does
                        address the hierarchy of authorities, because these powers of appointment are not
                        reciprocal. This idea is expanded by Marie Newhouse who argues ‘the legislative authority is
                        first among equals’ because it has ‘the capacity to make constitutional laws that allocate
                        authorities among institutions within the empirical state’.<sup><a
                                        href="./section_9.html#Fn76"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                                        </span>76</a></sup> However, the legalistic
                        understanding of the hierarchy still faces problems. One is that it makes it hard to
                        understand how the sovereign’s judgment in the population-wide murder conspiracy case can be
                        rightful. Recall that the sovereign does not act through ‘public law’ and, indeed, acts
                        contrary to established positive legislation.<sup><a href="./section_9.html#Fn77"><span
                                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>77</a></sup> The same problem
                        applies
                        at least to the case of forced levies which deviate ‘from previously existing law’.<sup><a
                                        href="./section_9.html#Fn78"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                                        </span>78</a></sup> Whilst it
                        might be possible to understand the sovereign’s powers of appointment in legal terms, if one
                        is available, an understanding of the hierarchy that can explain all its facets together is
                        preferable.</p>
                <p>A second problem with understanding the hierarchy as an assertion of the legal supremacy of
                        the sovereign over the regent and judge is it causes one to wonder in what sense a
                        separation of authorities really obtains at all. In his analysis, Guyer argues that the
                        hierarchy of authorities overrides any claim Kant might have to a separation of authorities.
                        Relying on a similarly legal understand of the hierarchy, Guyer presents us with a useful
                        challenge.<sup><a href="./section_9.html#Fn79"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                                        </span>79</a></sup>
                        Guyer claims ‘there is no clear sense in which the legislature is ever <i>subordinate</i> to
                        the executive’ and ‘As long as the entire judicial process – finding of fact, application of
                        law, enforcement of law – is governed by the laws of the legislature, the authorities
                        involved in the judicial process remain subordinate to the legislature. There is no obvious
                        sense in which the judiciary is coordinate to the legislature’.<sup><a
                                        href="./section_9.html#Fn80"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                                        </span>80</a></sup> Hence, Kant’s claim that
                        the three authorities are coordinate and subordinate to each other is a ‘rhetorical
                        flourish’.<sup><a href="./section_9.html#Fn81"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                                        </span>81</a></sup>
                        Yet given that Kant’s coordinate and subordinate claim occurs within the main text of <i>The
                                Doctrine of Right</i>, hence as part of Kant’s system of right and not, for example, in
                        the remarks or in the preface, it would be surprising if the claim were entirely
                        rhetorical.<sup><a href="./section_9.html#Fn82"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                                        </span>82</a></sup>
                        How, then, can we explain the hierarchy but not reduce Kant’s subordinate/coordinate claim –
                        and hence the separation of authorities – to mere rhetoric?</p>
                <p>The key, I believe, is the distinction between the two conceptions of sovereignty
                        distinguished in Section <a data-track="click" data-track-action="section anchor"
                                data-track-label="link" href="/article/10.1007/s10982-023-09486-w#Sec3">II</a>.
                        Over the previous two sections,
                        we have been looking closely at Kant’s conception of sovereignty as legislature. We have
                        seen that this sovereign is embedded in complex relations with the regent and the judge with
                        the purposes of establishing rightful law and ensuring the sovereign has the authority to
                        maintain the state. I now want to bring the conception of sovereignty as public authority
                        into the discussion. Recall that on this conception all the authorities and all the
                        authority of the state adhere to the sovereign. What we can now see is that there is a
                        certain fuzziness to the conception of sovereignty as legislature that blurs the distinction
                        with the conception of sovereign as public authority. The sovereign legislature does not
                        hold all authority in the state, but it does hold some authority over all other authorities
                        in the state. In other words, Kant’s sovereign legislature does not hold all state
                        authority, but is not simply one authority among three either.</p>
                <p>Narrowing the gap between two conceptions of an ambiguous concept is not to eliminate the
                        ambiguity, but in this case it does help us understand it. I suggest that the best way of
                        understanding this ambiguity is not as a failure of precise definition of a legal concept,
                        but as the use in practical reasoning of a political concept – hence I call this
                        interpretation <i>the political conception of sovereignty</i>. According to this reading,
                        the sovereign in the Kantian state holds all the authority of the state. However, they are
                        also under an obligation to alienate their authority over judicial and executive matters
                        onto other persons. The regent and the judge hold and enact the authority of the sovereign
                        in executive and legislative matters. This is what I take Kant to mean when he describes the
                        regent as an ‘<i>agent</i> of the state’ or the ‘organ of the sovereign’.<sup><a
                                        href="./section_9.html#Fn83"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                                        </span>83</a></sup> The
                        authority of the regent and the judge is ultimately the sovereign’s but ought to be actioned
                        by different persons. This also means that in cases such as the population-wide murder
                        conspiracy and the others discussed above, the sovereign has the authority and right to
                        intervene on the executive and judge in their functions because the sovereign is only
                        interfering with rights to executive and judicial authority that they already hold.</p>
                <p>On the political conception of sovereignty, both the conception as legislature and the
                        conception as public authority hold it certain respects. The sovereign is regarded as
                        holding all public authority but is also regarded as obligated to rule as a sovereign
                        legislature. Rightful law is established through a separation of authorities, and so the
                        sovereign is obligated to alienate executive and judicial authority onto other persons in
                        order to rule rightfully. In contrast to Guyer’s claim, then, there is a sense in which the
                        regent subordinates the sovereign. The sovereign is ideally subordinate to the regent and
                        the judge with regard to their functions in law-making. Kant’s claim that the three
                        authorities are coordinate and subordinate to each other thus holds in the form of an
                        imperative on the sovereign. Given that the separation of authorities comprises part of the
                        ideal state in idea, this imperative structure of the claim is not out of place.</p>
                <p>However, as we have seen, under some empirical circumstances maintaining or attaining such a
                        separation of authority becomes impossible without thereby imperilling the state upon the
                        existence of which the possibility of rightful law depends. So, the sovereign is also under
                        another obligation to maintain the state. These two obligations are not inherently
                        contradictory but can become so under certain empirical circumstances. Kant’s ambiguous and
                        political conception of sovereignty seems to leave us with a threat of contradiction, but it
                        is here that the role of political judgment emerges most clearly, and most decisively.
                        Kant’s sovereign is ambiguous because they are active in the politics of the state, not a
                        static legal institution which frames political life. The sovereign is tasked with judging
                        when the empirical circumstances permit rule through rightful law, and when they require the
                        sovereign to exercise their extra-legal authority. Once we understand this extra-legal or
                        political quality of Kant’s sovereign, we can also see how the sovereign’s judgment in the
                        population-wide murder conspiracy case can be understood as rightful, and do so in a way
                        consistent with other instances where the hierarchy is either expressed or invoked in <i>The
                                Doctrine of Right</i>. This gives us reason to favour a political over a legal reading
                        of Kant’s conception of sovereignty.</p>
                <p>As an example of political sovereignty in action, consider the right to punish. This is a
                        coercive right, and as such a right of executive authority.<sup><a
                                        href="./section_9.html#Fn84"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                                        </span>84</a></sup> What the political
                        conception implies is that the right to punish is a right of the sovereign, because all
                        rights of the state ultimately adhere to the sovereign. However, given the obligation to
                        establish rightful law and hence to rule through a separation of authorities, the exercise
                        of this authority ought to be carried out by the regent. The sovereign then rules rightfully
                        as a sovereign legislature without executive or judicial functions. This is ‘to make the
                        <i>kind of government</i> suited to the idea of the original contract’ or, as Kant would put
                        it elsewhere, to rule in ‘the spirit of a representative system’ or in a republican ‘manner
                        of governing’.<sup><a href="./section_9.html#Fn85"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                                        </span>85</a></sup> Fulfilling this obligation may require reforms of the state,
                        which Kant holds must ‘be carried out only through <i>reform</i> by the sovereign
                        itself…’<sup><a href="./section_9.html#Fn86"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                                        </span>86</a></sup>
                        The sovereign is required to judge when doing so is compatible with the ongoing existence of
                        the state. However, even once this step to separate authority is taken, the sovereign cannot
                        absolve themselves from affairs of state other than giving law. Recall the previously
                        discussed right of the sovereign to depose the regent if the regent becomes a threat to the
                        state. It is easy to imagine how a rogue regent with the right to punish through the
                        exercise of coercion might be such a threat and why Kant would want the sovereign to act
                        against them by deposing them. According to the political conception of sovereignty, the
                        political judgment as to when this is necessary falls to the sovereign.
                </p>
                <p>What is interesting about this is that it allows a certain flexibility for the sovereign to
                        approximate as closely as possible to rightful rule, even in circumstances which make this
                        very difficult. Kant is very hesitant about allowing the sovereign to exercise executive
                        authority under any circumstances. He writes ‘In that case the sovereign behaves through its
                        minister as also the regent and so as a despot’.<sup><a href="./section_9.html#Fn87"><span
                                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>87</a></sup> He is also
                        concerned that
                        any form of coercive resistance to the regent would be self-contradictory as the executive
                        authority is the supreme coercive authority. If another authority could resist them, they
                        would no longer be supreme. But the sovereign still has a course of action open to them
                        which they can take if they judge it necessary to maintain the state. They can strip the
                        regent of executive authority and appoint another in their place. The previous regent would
                        then return to being only a private citizen. Were they to continue to try to exercise
                        coercion this would be a clear wrong, and the new regent would be acting rightfully in
                        coercively putting down what now could only be described as a rebellion. These are the kind
                        of fine political judgments that the political sovereign is tasked with whether or not a
                        separation of authorities has already been established. The challenge for the sovereign is
                        to come as close to rightful ruling as the circumstances allow, which may even involve
                        backwards steps if the circumstances demand it.<sup><a href="./section_9.html#Fn88"><span
