                Separation of Authorities</h2>
<div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec8-content">
<p>If we can’t explain away the ambiguity, we can still try to explain it. To do this, we need
                    to look more closely at the conception of sovereignty as legislature. Understood as one
                    authority among three, Kant argues that it ought to be part of a separation of authorities.
                    Kant’s clearest statement of this is in the following passage:</p>
<blockquote class="c-blockquote">
<div class="c-blockquote__body">
<p><i>Accordingly, the three authorities in a state are, first, coordinate with one
                                another (potestates coordinatae) as so many moral persons, that is, each
                                complements the others to complete the constitution of a state (complementum ad
                                sufficientiam). But, secondly, they are also subordinate (subordinatae) to one
                                another, so that one of them, in assisting another, cannot also usurp its
                                function; instead, each has its own principles, that is, it indeed commands in
                                its capacity as a particular person, but still under the condition of the will
                                of a superior. Third, through the union of both each subject is apportioned his
                                rights</i>.<sup><a href="./section_9.html#Fn36"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote

                    As argued by Paul Guyer and others, Kant argues both for a separation of functional
                    authorities, and for a separation of the persons vested with those authorities.<sup><a href="./section_9.html#Fn37"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>37</a></sup> But Kant
                    goes further than this in the claims that the three authorities are ‘subordinate to one
                    another’ and none may usurp the function of either of the others. In the capacity or
                    ‘function’ of each dignity, none of the three persons may interfere with either of the other
                    two in the ‘function’ of their dignity. This is a true separation. As Ripstein rightly
                    points out, it does not take the form of instrumental checks and balances as is common in
                    separation of powers doctrines.<sup><a href="./section_9.html#Fn38"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>38</a></sup> Rather, each defines the limits of the others’ authority with
                    regards to apportioning rights. We might say that it is only in virtue of their co-ordinate
                    separation that each and all three together apportion rights. This requires the three
                    authorities to create, apply and maintain a system of laws.</p>
<p>The separation of authorities is the core feature of what Kant calls his <i>a priori</i>
                    ‘state in idea’ or ideal legal state. It is justified because it is necessary for the state
                    to establish rightful law. It serves to create the conditions in which rightful law can be
                    established, that is, in which law can be both rightful and effective in the external,
                    empirical world.<sup><a href="./section_9.html#Fn39"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>39</a></sup> To be rightful the law must be given by the general united or
                    omnilateral will. This is Rousseau’s general will but modified for Kant’s philosophical
                    purposes.<sup><a href="./section_9.html#Fn40"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>40</a></sup>
                    For Kant, the general will reflects his shared concern with Rousseau for autonomy; that all
                    moral laws, including laws of right, be somehow self-given. Kant rejects Hobbes’
                    unilaterally willing sovereign and replaces it with this omnilateral will which is given by
                    all and to all.<sup><a href="./section_9.html#Fn41"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>41</a></sup> The sovereign authority represents the omnilateral will and it
                    is the sovereign’s will that wills the laws. However, the omnilateral will is not sufficient
                    for establishing a system of laws. As well as omnilateral willing of laws, particular
                    willing is also required to apply law in particular cases, both in the giving of verdicts
                    where a case is submitted under the law, and in the application of coercive or incentivising
                    force to uphold the law. This particular willing is unilateral; it is neither given by all
                    or to all. Without particular willing, the omnilaterally willed laws could not take effect
                    in the world. The particular wills necessary for the state are embodied in the executive
                    regent and the judge, and it is only because they are the particular wills of particular
                    persons that they can perform their functions within the state. Only the sovereign
                    represents the general will directly, not the regent or the judge.</p>
<p>The omnilateral and particular willing of a system of law is made possible by the separation
                    of authorities. The sovereign represents the omnilateral will and so can only will laws the
                    same for all and for each. The sovereign cannot, for this reason, deal with particular
                    cases.<sup><a href="./section_9.html#Fn42"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>42</a></sup> For
                    the sovereign to act in these cases would be to act ‘beneath its dignity’ as the sovereign’s
                    subjects have particular wills and the sovereign is a superior not an equal of its
                    subjects.<sup><a href="./section_9.html#Fn43"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>43</a></sup>
                    One might even say that in intervening in a particular case, the sovereign would be
                    relinquishing their right of representation of the omnilateral will.<sup><a href="./section_9.html#Fn44"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>44</a></sup> Certainly,
                    they would be overstepping the bounds of their authority and threaten the rightfulness of
                    the system of laws. By separating a regent to govern using coercion or other incentives
                    ‘directed to particular cases’ and the judge to give verdicts in particular cases, Kant
                    makes possible the particular willing that makes possible an effective system of law.<sup><a href="./section_9.html#Fn45"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>45</a></sup> The laws
                    remain legitimate because both judge and regent are subordinated to the omnilaterally willed
                    law and may not make law themselves. Hence, the regent can will only decrees ‘given as
                    subject to being changed’ and not laws.<sup><a href="./section_9.html#Fn46"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>46</a></sup> Moreover, the judge must
                    be a separate person from the regent because both the regent and judge are particular
                    persons with particular wills. This means that the regent cannot judge in their own case,
                    except with the danger of them thereby committing a wrong.<sup><a href="./section_9.html#Fn47"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>47</a></sup> In so far as the regent
                    is to be held accountable under the laws of the sovereign, they must therefore not judge in
                    their own case.<sup><a href="./section_9.html#Fn48"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>48</a></sup> One might think there is a problem here in that the judge could
                    judge in their own case. This is what Kant describes happening in a case of equity. Perhaps
                    because he is aware of this point the scope of the judge to give verdicts on non-lawful
                    grounds of equity is severely curtailed.<sup><a href="./section_9.html#Fn49"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>49</a></sup> However, since
                    inappealability of the highest judge is inherent in the concept of judicial authority, there
                    is in the extreme case no route of appeal and no-one else could have standing to make this
                    judgment.<sup><a href="./section_9.html#Fn50"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>50</a></sup>
                    Kant’s justification of the separation of authorities is thus designed to allow the state to
                    establish a system of laws which is legitimate because the laws proceed from the general
                    united will, but also effective because it can address particular cases and subsume these
                    under law.</p>
<p>This crucial argument that the separation of authorities is the necessary condition of
                    rightful law-making is widely accepted in the literature, even if the reading of the
                    argument Kant gives may differ somewhat to the one I have presented here. Byrd and Hruschka
                    argue that each of the authorities is necessary for the establishment of a rightful
                    condition under universal law, and that the separation of authorities in accordance with the
                    state in idea is part of what is necessary for fulfilling the ideal constitutional
                    principles of a state that rules through rightful law.<sup><a href="./section_9.html#Fn51"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>51</a></sup> For Ripstein, each of the
                    authorities is necessary for the possibility of omnilateral law-making as each solves a
                    normative problem of the state of nature.<sup><a href="./section_9.html#Fn52"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>52</a></sup> The legislature solves
                    the problem of unilateralism in property acquisition by underwriting such acquisitions with
                    omnilateral law. The executive provides assurance that legal rights will be respected. The
                    judiciary resolves the indeterminacies that arise in the application of universal laws to
                    particulars. In the absence of a state and the three authorities, each of these problems can
                    only be resolved unilaterally and hence threatens equal freedom.<sup><a href="./section_9.html#Fn53"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>53</a></sup> It is not my purpose in
                    this paper to suggest either of these readings is wrong. When it comes to the separation of
                    authorities, I believe Kantian legalists are right to stress its role in setting the
                    conditions for omnilateral law-making. Where I do diverge is on the second feature of the
                    complex relations between the three authorities in Kant’s ‘state in idea’ which is the
                    hierarchy of authorities. The arguments I present concerning the hierarchy can be applied to
                    any account of the separation of authorities that retains the concern with necessity of the
                    separation of authorities for rightful law-making.</p>
