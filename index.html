            Abstract</h2>
        <div class="c-article-section__content" id="Abs1-content">
            <p>Kantian legalism is now the dominant scholarly interpretation of Kant and an important approach
                to legal and political philosophy in its own right. One notable feature is its construal of the
                relationship between law and politics decisively in law’s favour: Law subordinates politics.
                Political judgment is constrained by and only permissibly exercised through law. This paper
                opposes this subordination through a close analysis of an ambiguity in Kant’s conception of
                sovereignty. Understanding this ambiguity requires seeing that, for Kant, law cannot subordinate
                the sovereign’s political judgment because it is a condition which makes a legal system
                possible. Kant was not an exacting legalist, but a practical reasoner struggling with the
                pressures politics imposes on finite beings. Through discussion of a leading contemporary
                approach, and close engagement with its historical source, the paper raises new considerations
                about the relevance of political judgment in the relationship of law and politics.</p>

        <p>This paper addresses the relationship between law and politics in the context of legalistic readings
            of Kant’s political philosophy, as found in its most mature statement <i>The Doctrine of Right</i>.
            This ‘Kantian legalism’ refers to the recent interpretation and development of Kant’s political
            philosophy that is best exemplified in Arthur Ripstein’s <i>Force and Freedom</i>, Sharon B. Byrd
            and Joachim Hruscka’s <i>Kant’s Doctrine of Right: A commentary</i>,<sup><a href="#Fn1"><span
                        class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>1</a></sup> and subsequent work influenced by
            these two texts. There the relationship between law and politics is decisively in law’s favour: Law
            subordinates politics. Political judgment is constrained by and only permissibly exercised through
            law. In other words, political judgment has its place, but this place is within the legal order.
            This is now the dominant approach to Kant’s political philosophy in English and it is not only a
            scholarly project. Kantian legalism is now proposed as a liberal and republican approach to legal
            and political philosophy in its own right.<sup><a href="#Fn2"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                    </span>2</a></sup> Ripstein is as engaged in the
            philosophy of law as well as historical scholarship.<sup><a href="#Fn3"><span
                        class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>3</a></sup> Moreover, Kantian legalism is
            applied to contemporary questions in the philosophy of law and politics.<sup><a href="#Fn4"><span

    <div class="c-article-section__content">
        <p>I have a good deal of admiration and sympathy for Kantian legalism, so my project in this paper is
            not oppositional, but cautionary. I cannot endorse the full-throated subordination of politics to
            law, nor do I think Kant himself would either. Kantian legalism leaves out something distinctly
            <i>political</i> in Kant which makes law possible. This is the role of political judgment, which I
            highlight through a close analysis of Kant’s conception of sovereignty. Only a political, rather
            than legalist reading explains how an ambiguity in Kant’s conception of sovereignty is resolved
            through judgment. The substantive consequence of this for our reading of Kant is a reappraisal of
            the nature of his commitment to the rule of law. It should also give us pause before reading Kant’s
            political philosophy as exacting legalism. I suggest it is better read as a sustained work of
            practical reasoning which embraces the limitations of all human thought and struggles against the
            pressures that politics imposes on us as finite beings. It is only judgment, not law, that gives
            human beings a chance to manage these pressures. This thought is left out of Kantian legalism
            because it doesn’t attend to what is ambiguous and political in Kant’s concept of sovereignty.
            Through this discussion of a leading contemporary approach to legal and political philosophy, and
            close engagement with its historical source, I hope to raise new considerations about the role of
            political judgment in our thinking about the broader, general, and perhaps perennial question of the
            relationship of law and politics.

                Kantian Legalism</h2>
            <div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec2-content">
                <p>Legalism is an approach to political and legal philosophy characterised by the subordination
                    of politics to law.<sup><a href="#Fn5"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>5</a></sup> Political problems are resolved by subjecting them to legal
                    processes, and rightful political action takes place within the constraints of law. More
                    than this, the idea is that rightful political action, especially state action and power,
                    ought to be exercised through law and legal processes. I introduce and use the term ‘Kantian
                    legalism’ here to refer to readings of Kant’s political philosophy, especially in <i>The
                        Doctrine of Right</i>, along these lines.<sup><a href="#Fn6"><span
                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>6</a></sup> These have become
                    especially influential within Kant scholarship in the last decade.<sup><a href="#Fn7"><span
                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>7</a></sup></p>
                <p>Kantian legalists differ on the details, but they all agree that, for Kant, the freedom and
                    equality of all citizens is realised through law and the legal state; the
                    <i>Rechtsstaat</i>. The freedom and equality of citizens cannot be achieved in the state of
                    nature. This is because in the state of nature the relations between individuals are in some
                    way problematically unilateral when it comes to rights claims such as property and contract.
                    The thought is that if individuals are free and equal, then there is a problem to explain
                    how the ability of any individual to place others under obligations through rights claims
                    (such as to not interfere with an object by claiming that object as my property) can be
                    compatible with the equal freedom of all. The solution to this is law grounded on the
                    omnilateral or general united will. The sovereign of the legal state represents this will
                    while making laws and thus the law is not unilateral, and the law can then underly the
                    actions of individuals. The state is structured to achieve this end which Kant calls a
                    rightful condition. As Thomas Sinclair puts it: ‘The most important means by which this is
                    achieved is that there exist legislative, judicial, and executive roles in the Kantian state
                    that are defined by obligations to create and sustain through law a rightful
                    condition’.<sup><a href="#Fn8"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>8</a></sup>
                    It is thus law and legal processes which secure the freedom and equality of citizens
                    according to Kantian legalism. The effect of this on politics is to subordinate it to law.
                    Free relations between individuals are guaranteed only insofar as politics is subjected to
                    legal processes which are omnilaterally legitimated.
                </p>
                <p>Kantian legalism thus contains substantive commitments, such as to the rule of law. But it is
                    also a philosophical approach that holds a particular view about the purpose of Kant’s
                    political and legal philosophy. Kantian legalism holds that the principles Kant derives are
                    not only realised through law, but that Kantian political principles <i>are</i> the
                    principles of legal systems. <i>The Doctrine of Right</i> is taken to be the elaboration of
                    the philosophical principles that comprise the ideal legal system that would fully realise
                    freedom and equality. The task of politics is to apply these <i>a priori</i> principles in
                    the real world and, when this is done, we achieve a rightful condition. Importantly,
                    rightful politics then becomes a matter of specifying these <i>a priori</i> principles in
                    practice by making law, and all other political action needs to take place within the
                    constraints of this law. Rightful politics becomes a fundamentally legal matter.</p>
                <p>Unsurprisingly, then, law is central to Kantian legalism, but what of political judgment? I
                    have signalled that my challenge to Kantian legalism will be to stress the relative
                    importance of political judgment as against that of law in <i>The Doctrine of Right</i>, so
                    what does Kantian legalism say about judgment? As I see it, judgment has three roles within
                    Kantian legalism but each of these roles shares a common dependence upon the existence of a
                    legal order, in virtue of which each of these kinds of judgment might be described as legal
                    and not political. The first role of judgment is as verdict: The decision of a court is ‘a
                    <i>judgment</i>’.<sup><a href="#Fn9"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>9</a></sup> Verdict is the judgment, ‘an individual act of public justice’,
                    by which the judge applies positive law in a particular case.<sup><a href="#Fn10"><span
                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>10</a></sup> That is, the verdict of a
                    judge resolves Kant’s practical syllogism: ‘These are like the three propositions in a
                    practical syllogism: the major premise, which contains the law of that will; the minor
                    premise, which contains the command to behave in accordance with the law, that is, the
                    principle of subsumption under the law; and the conclusion, which contains the verdict
                    (sentence), what is laid down as right in the case at hand’.<sup><a href="#Fn11"><span
                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>11</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>Verdict is perhaps the paradigmatic example of legal judgment, but the second role for
                    judgment in Kantian legalism is administrative judgment. State officials are able to make
                    judgments that individuals would not because they hold a legally defined public office that
                    authorises them to make certain judgments. As the office is legally defined and the law is
                    conceived as omnilateral, what would be problematically unilateral for the private person to
                    do is not problematic for the public office holder.<sup><a href="#Fn12"><span
                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>12</a></sup> The final and third role
                    for judgment in Kantian legalism is legislative judgment. This is the kind of judgment
                    involved in omnilateral public law-making, in which <i>a priori</i> principles of law are
                    specified in positive legislation.</p>
                <p>Each of these roles for judgment is premised on the legal order. That is, they are judgments
                    that take place within established institutional and legal constraints – principally the
                    separation of authorities. The judge only passes verdict on laws passed by the legislature,
                    state officials only judge within the constraints of their offices as defined in law by the
                    legislature, and the legislature does no more than pass law as one of three state
                    authorities. Rightful political judgment is, in this sense, legal judgment according to
                    Kantian legalism. Every political judgment can be given effect through law because rightful
                    political judgment always operates within the legal order of the <i>Rechsstaat</i>.<sup><a
                            href="#Fn13"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>13</a></sup> It is this
                    feature of Kantian legalism which my argument is intended to challenge. Rightful political
                    judgment need not be given effect through law, nor operate within the legal order on my
                    reading of <i>The Doctrine of Right</i>. In particular, the rightful political judgment of
                    the sovereign need not be legal. Indeed, the legal order itself depends on the sovereign’s
                    political judgment, not the other way around.</p>

            <div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec3-content">
                <p>In order to see the important role of political judgment in <i>The Doctrine of Right</i>, we
                    need to look carefully at the role of the sovereign. There is a core and systematic
                    ambiguity in Kant’s concept sovereignty which can best be understood as being resolved by
                    political judgment and in relation to a political conception of sovereignty, not through
                    legal judgment and a legal conception. Now, to say that there are ambiguities in the concept
                    of sovereignty would not strike political philosophers as being anything new.<sup><a
                            href="#Fn14"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>14</a></sup> The most
                    frequently discussed ambiguities in the notion of sovereignty involve either the relation of
                    the state to the sovereign, or that of the people to the sovereign state, and one finds
                    these in <i>The Doctrine of Right</i> too.<sup><a href="#Fn15"><span
                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>15</a></sup> But there is a different
                    ambiguity in Kant that relates to the relationship of law and politics, and it concerns the
                    scope of the sovereign’s authority in relation to the other authorities of the state.<sup><a
                            href="#Fn16"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>16</a></sup></p>
                <h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec4">The Three Authorities</h3>
                <p>As noted above, Kant distinguishes three state authorities – sovereign or legislative,
                    executive and judicial – and three persons who each hold one of these authorities –
                    sovereign or legislator, regent and judge. Each authority has different powers in the
                    Kantian state. Sovereign authority gives general or universal laws for the state.<sup><a
                            href="#Fn17"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>17</a></sup> The laws
                    are ‘the same (…) for all and all for each’ meaning that the laws are given by all (united)
                    and to all (general). For this reason, sovereign authority belongs to the general united
                    will of the people, though vested in the person of the legislator.<sup><a href="#Fn18"><span
                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>18</a></sup> The executive authority
                    provides coercive physical power and other incentives to enforce the laws. It is held by the
                    person of the regent, who is also called the governor, the directorate or government.<sup><a
                            href="#Fn19"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>19</a></sup> The regent
                    provides directives and decrees, not laws, and governs the state. The regent is the only
                    authority which can exercise coercion and punish, but, as an agent of the state, they are
                    subject to the laws of the sovereign.<sup><a href="#Fn20"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>20</a></sup> The judicial authority
                    provides verdicts on applications of the law to particular cases. As with the executive
                    authority, the judicial authority is constrained by the laws of the sovereign and may not
                    deviate from them.<sup><a href="#Fn21"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>21</a></sup> These three authorities are essential for the establishment of a
                    state and are ‘dignities’, meaning they are ‘eminent estates without pay’ or what we could
                    call political or civil statuses.<sup><a href="#Fn22"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote

                <p>Kant’s discussion of the three authorities has been noted for its obscurity.<sup><a
                            href="#Fn23"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>23</a></sup> One reason
                    for this may be that when considered in relation to these three authorities of the state,
                    Kant’s concept of sovereignty appears to be ambiguous between two conceptions. The first is
                    the conception of <i>sovereignty as public authority</i>, which refers to the three
                    authorities of the state taken together:</p>

                    <div class="c-blockquote__body">

                                will of the people, which is derived a priori from reason. They are a pure idea
                                of a head of state, which has objective practical reality. But this head of
                                state (the sovereign) is only a thought-entity (to represent the entire people)
                                as long as there is no physical person to represent the supreme authority in the

                    In this passage, the sovereign – as a thought entity – represents the people as united in a
                    commonwealth and so contains within it the three authorities.<sup><a href="#Fn25"><span

                    then represented by a physical person, the sovereign, and so this physical person also
                    represents public authority in general. This person, Kant goes on to say, could be an
                    autocrat, or an aristocratic or democratic assembly.<sup><a href="#Fn26"><span

                <p>The second, opposing, conception of sovereignty is <i>sovereignty as legislature</i>. Instead
                    of conceiving of sovereignty as containing all three authorities, this conception conceives
                    of sovereignty as only one of the authorities: ‘the sovereign authority (sovereignty) in the
                    person of the legislator’.<sup><a href="#Fn27"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>27</a></sup> This sovereign authority only has part of the authority of the
                    state, that of legislation. As a consequence, Kant describes the sovereign as interacting
                    with the other state authorities: ‘The sovereign may take the regent’s authority away from
                    him…’ and ‘the sovereign must also have in his power, in this case of necessity (<i>casus
                        necessitatis</i>), to assume to role of the judge (to represent him) and pronounce a
                    judgment…’<sup><a href="#Fn28"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>28</a></sup>
                    This sovereign holds not public authority <i>in general</i> but only one part of public
                    authority, that of <i>legislation</i>.<sup><a href="#Fn29"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote

                <h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec7">Ambiguous Sovereignty in Kantian Legalism</h3>
                <p>This ambiguity between <i>sovereignty as public authority</i> and <i>sovereignty as
                        legislature</i> is carried over into Kantian legalism. I say ‘carried over’ because it
                    is not actively theorised by Kantian legalists, but nonetheless remains present in their
                    texts. Jacob Weinrib is an exception in noting the ambiguity, but his purposes lead him away
                    from discussing it further.<sup><a href="#Fn30"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>30</a></sup> More often the ambiguity is carried over without comment. As an
                    example, Ripstein states that ‘the three branches: legislature, executive and judiciary.
                    Together, they comprise the sovereign’.<sup><a href="#Fn31"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>31</a></sup> Yet he also writes ‘the
                    sovereign (legislature) also has the power to tax and to spend monies on the creation of
                    public spaces…’<sup><a href="#Fn32"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>32</a></sup> I suspect the ambiguity is untheorized simply because the
                    legalist approach calls for precise definition and delineation of important concepts, and
                    Kant’s imprecision on this point can be chalked up to poor drafting, his self-confessed
                    rushed exposition, or <i>The Doctrine of Right’s</i> troubled publication history.<sup><a
                            href="#Fn33"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>33</a></sup> Yet it is
                    because I noticed that this ambiguity is carried over, even into the very phrasing and
                    formulation of these texts, that I first began to suspect it had systematic importance.</p>
                <p>If confronted by the ambiguity, however, a Kantian legalist might attempt to argue that with
                    a more precise delineation of terms the ambiguity could be eliminated. There are two
                    approaches that are most promising for this task, but neither is successful. The first is to
                    draw on the distinction between a public office and the person who holds it, as discussed in
                    Section <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="section anchor"
                        href="/article/10.1007/s10982-023-09486-w#Sec2">I</a> in the context of administrative
                    judgment. Using this distinction, one could argue that there is no ambiguity in Kant’s
                    concept of sovereignty, it is just that Kant sometimes refers to the office and at others to
                    the person. However, the ambiguity transcends this distinction. I have highlighted above how
                    when conceiving of sovereignty as public authority, the sovereign is a thought entity that
                    comprises the three authorities taken together which is itself represented by a physical
                    person. By contrast, when sovereignty is conceived as legislature, the sovereign authority
                    as an office is represented in the person of the sovereign (legislator). In other words,
                    Kant conceives of both sovereignty as public authority and sovereignty as legislature as
                    both an office and a person and so the ambiguity remains.<sup><a href="#Fn34"><span
                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>34</a></sup></p>
                <p>The second approach is to argue that the concept of representation can be invoked to defuse
                    the ambiguity.<sup><a href="#Fn35"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>35</a></sup> As again discussed in Section <a data-track="click"
                        data-track-label="link" data-track-action="section anchor"
                        href="/article/10.1007/s10982-023-09486-w#Sec2">I</a>, for Kant and for Kantian
                    legalists, the sovereign represents the general united or omnilateral will. One might think
                    there is some way to explain the ambiguity away by these means. One might think, for
                    example, that because the sovereign as legislature is closely connected to the general
                    united will, that this is what needs to be represented by a physical person, and this
                    physical person is the sovereign as public authority; however, this would be to miss the
                    point. The question is, what is the idea or thought entity of sovereignty that is
                    represented? Is it the conception as one legislative authority, or the conception of three
                    public authorities together?</p>

                <p>If we can’t explain away the ambiguity, we can still try to explain it. To do this, we need
                    to look more closely at the conception of sovereignty as legislature. Understood as one
                    authority among three, Kant argues that it ought to be part of a separation of authorities.
                    Kant’s clearest statement of this is in the following passage:</p>
                <blockquote class="c-blockquote">
                    <div class="c-blockquote__body">
                        <p><i>Accordingly, the three authorities in a state are, first, coordinate with one
                                another (potestates coordinatae) as so many moral persons, that is, each
                                complements the others to complete the constitution of a state (complementum ad
                                sufficientiam). But, secondly, they are also subordinate (subordinatae) to one
                                another, so that one of them, in assisting another, cannot also usurp its
                                function; instead, each has its own principles, that is, it indeed commands in
                                its capacity as a particular person, but still under the condition of the will
                                of a superior. Third, through the union of both each subject is apportioned his

                <p>
                    As argued by Paul Guyer and others, Kant argues both for a separation of functional
                    authorities, and for a separation of the persons vested with those authorities.<sup><a
                            href="#Fn37"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>37</a></sup> But Kant
                    goes further than this in the claims that the three authorities are ‘subordinate to one
                    another’ and none may usurp the function of either of the others. In the capacity or
                    ‘function’ of each dignity, none of the three persons may interfere with either of the other
                    two in the ‘function’ of their dignity. This is a true separation. As Ripstein rightly
                    points out, it does not take the form of instrumental checks and balances as is common in
                    separation of powers doctrines.<sup><a href="#Fn38"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>38</a></sup> Rather, each defines the limits of the others’ authority with
                    regards to apportioning rights. We might say that it is only in virtue of their co-ordinate
                    separation that each and all three together apportion rights. This requires the three
                    authorities to create, apply and maintain a system of laws.</p>
                <p>The separation of authorities is the core feature of what Kant calls his <i>a priori</i>
                    ‘state in idea’ or ideal legal state. It is justified because it is necessary for the state
                    to establish rightful law. It serves to create the conditions in which rightful law can be
                    established, that is, in which law can be both rightful and effective in the external,
                    empirical world.<sup><a href="#Fn39"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>39</a></sup> To be rightful the law must be given by the general united or
                    omnilateral will. This is Rousseau’s general will but modified for Kant’s philosophical
                    purposes.<sup><a href="#Fn40"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>40</a></sup>
                    For Kant, the general will reflects his shared concern with Rousseau for autonomy; that all
                    moral laws, including laws of right, be somehow self-given. Kant rejects Hobbes’
                    unilaterally willing sovereign and replaces it with this omnilateral will which is given by
                    all and to all.<sup><a href="#Fn41"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>41</a></sup> The sovereign authority represents the omnilateral will and it
                    is the sovereign’s will that wills the laws. However, the omnilateral will is not sufficient
                    for establishing a system of laws. As well as omnilateral willing of laws, particular
                    willing is also required to apply law in particular cases, both in the giving of verdicts
                    where a case is submitted under the law, and in the application of coercive or incentivising
                    force to uphold the law. This particular willing is unilateral; it is neither given by all
                    or to all. Without particular willing, the omnilaterally willed laws could not take effect
                    in the world. The particular wills necessary for the state are embodied in the executive
                    regent and the judge, and it is only because they are the particular wills of particular
                    persons that they can perform their functions within the state. Only the sovereign
                    represents the general will directly, not the regent or the judge.</p>
                <p>The omnilateral and particular willing of a system of law is made possible by the separation
                    of authorities. The sovereign represents the omnilateral will and so can only will laws the
                    same for all and for each. The sovereign cannot, for this reason, deal with particular
                    cases.<sup><a href="#Fn42"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>42</a></sup> For
                    the sovereign to act in these cases would be to act ‘beneath its dignity’ as the sovereign’s
                    subjects have particular wills and the sovereign is a superior not an equal of its
                    subjects.<sup><a href="#Fn43"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>43</a></sup>
                    One might even say that in intervening in a particular case, the sovereign would be
                    relinquishing their right of representation of the omnilateral will.<sup><a href="#Fn44"><span
                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>44</a></sup> Certainly,
                    they would be overstepping the bounds of their authority and threaten the rightfulness of
                    the system of laws. By separating a regent to govern using coercion or other incentives
                    ‘directed to particular cases’ and the judge to give verdicts in particular cases, Kant
                    makes possible the particular willing that makes possible an effective system of law.<sup><a
                            href="#Fn45"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>45</a></sup> The laws
                    remain legitimate because both judge and regent are subordinated to the omnilaterally willed
                    law and may not make law themselves. Hence, the regent can will only decrees ‘given as
                    subject to being changed’ and not laws.<sup><a href="#Fn46"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>46</a></sup> Moreover, the judge must
                    be a separate person from the regent because both the regent and judge are particular
                    persons with particular wills. This means that the regent cannot judge in their own case,
                    except with the danger of them thereby committing a wrong.<sup><a href="#Fn47"><span
                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>47</a></sup> In so far as the regent
                    is to be held accountable under the laws of the sovereign, they must therefore not judge in
                    their own case.<sup><a href="#Fn48"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>48</a></sup> One might think there is a problem here in that the judge could
                    judge in their own case. This is what Kant describes happening in a case of equity. Perhaps
                    because he is aware of this point the scope of the judge to give verdicts on non-lawful
                    grounds of equity is severely curtailed.<sup><a href="#Fn49"><span
                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>49</a></sup> However, since
                    inappealability of the highest judge is inherent in the concept of judicial authority, there
                    is in the extreme case no route of appeal and no-one else could have standing to make this
                    judgment.<sup><a href="#Fn50"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>50</a></sup>
                    Kant’s justification of the separation of authorities is thus designed to allow the state to
                    establish a system of laws which is legitimate because the laws proceed from the general
                    united will, but also effective because it can address particular cases and subsume these
                    under law.</p>
                <p>This crucial argument that the separation of authorities is the necessary condition of
                    rightful law-making is widely accepted in the literature, even if the reading of the
                    argument Kant gives may differ somewhat to the one I have presented here. Byrd and Hruschka
                    argue that each of the authorities is necessary for the establishment of a rightful
                    condition under universal law, and that the separation of authorities in accordance with the
                    state in idea is part of what is necessary for fulfilling the ideal constitutional
                    principles of a state that rules through rightful law.<sup><a href="#Fn51"><span
                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>51</a></sup> For Ripstein, each of the
                    authorities is necessary for the possibility of omnilateral law-making as each solves a
                    normative problem of the state of nature.<sup><a href="#Fn52"><span
                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>52</a></sup> The legislature solves
                    the problem of unilateralism in property acquisition by underwriting such acquisitions with
                    omnilateral law. The executive provides assurance that legal rights will be respected. The
                    judiciary resolves the indeterminacies that arise in the application of universal laws to
                    particulars. In the absence of a state and the three authorities, each of these problems can
                    only be resolved unilaterally and hence threatens equal freedom.<sup><a href="#Fn53"><span
                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>53</a></sup> It is not my purpose in
                    this paper to suggest either of these readings is wrong. When it comes to the separation of
                    authorities, I believe Kantian legalists are right to stress its role in setting the
                    conditions for omnilateral law-making. Where I do diverge is on the second feature of the
                    complex relations between the three authorities in Kant’s ‘state in idea’ which is the
                    hierarchy of authorities. The arguments I present concerning the hierarchy can be applied to
                    any account of the separation of authorities that retains the concern with necessity of the
                    separation of authorities for rightful law-making.</p>

                <p>As well as a separation of the three authorities, Kant also establishes a hierarchy of the
                    three authorities with the sovereign at the top. Beyond the direct functions of the state
                    authorities with regard to the establishment of law, the sovereign legislature holds powers
                    over the other two authorities which are not matched with symmetrical powers. This creates a

                <p>The first sentence shows that the sovereign has authority over the regent – i.e. the person
                    who holds executive authority – in a right to remove, depose or reform them. The sovereign
                    legislature’s authority here does not manifest in a right to exercise executive authority
                    against the regent, but to strip their authority rendering them no more than a private
                    citizen.<sup><a href="#Fn55"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>55</a></sup>
                    The sovereign has the authority to decide who can exercise executive authority and, to that
                    extent, how they exercise it.</p>
                <p><i>The Doctrine of Right</i> also gives the sovereign legislature authority over the judge or
                    judicial authority. First, the sovereign has power of appointment of judges: ‘neither the
                    head of state nor regent can judge, but can only appoint judges as magistrates’.<sup><a
                            href="#Fn56"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>56</a></sup> Second, in
                    certain circumstances or ‘cases of necessity’ the sovereign has the power to ‘assume the
                    role of judge’ and decree a different sentence to that pronounced by the judge.<sup><a
                            href="#Fn57"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>57</a></sup> Finally,
                    the sovereign also has the right to grant clemency of which Kant says: ‘This right is the
                    only one that deserves to be called the right of majesty’.<sup><a href="#Fn58"><span
                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>58</a></sup> The right of clemency is
                    limited. Firstly, it is restricted to cases of ‘wrongs done to himself’ i.e., to the
                    sovereign, and never ‘crimes of <i>subjects</i> against one another’.<sup><a href="#Fn59"><span
                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>59</a></sup> One
                    plausible interpretation of this restriction is that the right of clemency only applies in
                    the case of a crime against the state, not a private person, or crimes of public law, and
                    not private law. Secondly, even then the right of clemency may not be invoked if it ‘could
                    endanger the people’s security’.<sup><a href="#Fn60"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>60</a></sup> Nonetheless, the right of
                    clemency is a second right of the sovereign legislature to annul the verdict of the judge.
                    There are no symmetrical powers for the judge over the sovereign legislature. Nor are there
                    such powers for the regent.</p>
                <p>Kant has a principled reason for endorsing this hierarchy of authorities as well as the
                    separation of authorities. This is the necessity of the state as the condition for possible
                    law-making. To see why this is the case, it will be helpful to consider the example of
                    Kant’s ‘population-wide murder conspiracy’, before moving on to the justification in
                    general.<sup><a href="#Fn61"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>61</a></sup> It
                    is worth quoting in full:</p>

                                priori. – If, however, the number of accomplices is so great that the state, in
                                order to have no such criminals in it, could soon find itself without subjects;
                                and if the state still does not want to dissolve, that is, to pass over into a

                <p>
                    In this case, the judge is confronted by a murder conspiracy encompassing the whole, or
                    nearly whole, population. By law the rightful judgment is to execute each of the citizens.
                    The reason for this is that for the crime of murder, no punishment is adequate but that the
                    perpetrator die.<sup><a href="#Fn63"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>63</a></sup> Earlier in the section from which this passage is taken, Kant
                    also states that the law of punishment in general is a categorical imperative.<sup><a
                            href="#Fn64"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>64</a></sup> So it is
                    not only that by positive, or what Kant calls subjective, law that the judge ought to
                    pronounce this verdict, but by objective law, grounded <i>a priori</i> and established by
                    the sovereign legislature.<sup><a href="#Fn65"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>65</a></sup> Following this, the executive regent ought to carry out the
                    executions. This course of action would be the three authorities performing their respective
                    functions in accordance with the separation of authorities. The sovereign establishes the
                    lawful punishment for murder in accordance with <i>a priori</i> principles; the judge
                    applies the law through their verdict; and the executive regent carries out the extreme
                    coercive function of executing the entire population. Yet Kant still holds that the
                    sovereign must intervene via a ‘Machtspruch’ to prevent this from happening. How can this be
                    justified and made compatible with the justification for the separation of authorities?</p>
                <p>The key is to see how the sovereign still represents the omnilateral will throughout this
                    case. Kant’s reasoning is that carrying out the original verdict would lead to the risk that
                    the state would ‘pass over into the state of nature, which is far worse because there is no
                    external justice at all’. In the unlikely empirical circumstances Kant imagines, the
                    normally desirable fact that the particular willing of the regent and the judge cannot be
                    directed at anything other than applying a general law in a particular case has created a
                    situation in which the state, lawfully and rightfully, might rule itself out of existence,
                    thus destroying any possibility of rightful lawgiving. Without population there cannot be a
                    state and without a state there cannot be rightful laws. The judge’s particular will is
                    constrained by omnilateral law to will the destruction of the conditions that make such
                    willing possible: But this is a contradiction in willing. For this reason, the sovereign
                    acts in a particular case whilst still representing the omnilateral will because that act
                    secures the conditions for the possibility of the omnnilateral willing of rightful laws. The
                    sovereign assumes the role of the judge, exercises their authority to pronounce a sentence
                    that maintains the population, such as deportation to another province, and carries it out
                    through executive decree. The separation of authorities is violated, but the sovereign does
                    not act from their particular will, and so is rightful and justified in doing so.</p>
                <p>The population-wide murder conspiracy is not the only place in which Kant explicitly makes
                    clear his commitment to justifying the sovereign’s right to maintain the existence of the
                    state. Kant also argues that the sovereign, in addition to rights of taxation, may further
                    levy forced loans, even in cases where that deviates ‘from previously existing law’ when
                    ‘the state is in danger of dissolution’.<sup><a href="#Fn66"><span
                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>66</a></sup> In a similar vein, Kant’s
                    justification of the right of the state to tax where it is necessary to maintain ‘the
                    <i>poor</i>, <i>foundling homes</i> and <i>church organizations</i>’ is based on his view
                    that ‘The general will of the people has united itself into a society which is to
                    <i>maintain itself perpetually</i>; and for this end it has submitted itself to the internal
                    authority of the state in order to maintain those members of the society who are unable to
                    maintain themselves’.<sup><a href="#Fn67"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>67</a></sup> Beyond <i>The Doctrine of Right</i>, in <i>Toward Perpetual
                        Peace</i>, Kant discusses the possibility of permissive laws that allow the sovereign to
                    postpone putting laws into effect lest that see the state ‘devoured by other states’.<sup><a
                            href="#Fn68"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>68</a></sup> Again,
                    Kant justifies the sovereign acting in defence of the state. This indicates that, although
                    the population-wide murder conspiracy is an incredibly unlikely and exceptional
                    circumstance, this authority of sovereign is invoked in the normal course of
                    politics.<sup><a href="#Fn69"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>69</a></sup>
                    However, the population-wide murder conspiracy is the most important example in the present
                    context because it is in that case that Kant says explicitly that the sovereign is justified
                    in violating the law and the separation of authorities in order to maintain the state.
                </p>
                <p>This line of reasoning can be expanded to cover the other cases in which the sovereign
                    violates the separation of authorities and thus justifies the hierarchy overall. The
                    sovereign intervenes on the executive and judicial authorities when doing so is necessary
                    for maintaining the state, as the condition which makes rightful lawgiving possible, under
                    empirical conditions that may not always be favourable to this. For example, the authority
                    to strip the regent of executive authority means that should the regent, who is of course a
                    finite human being and therefore fallible, begin to threaten the state, then the sovereign
                    is able to rightfully intervene. Therefore, the sovereign’s authority allows them to
                    maintain the state in cases where the application of law through separated authorities is
                    not sufficient to the task, or even where the application of the law itself is the source of
                    the threat.</p>

            <div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec10-content">
                <p>The hierarchy of authorities thus rests on the principled need to maintain the existence of
                    the state as the condition of possible law-making. But how are we to understand this
                    principle and in turn understand the nature of sovereignty in <i>The Doctrine of Right</i>?
                    In the literature, the hierarchy of authorities, and therefore sovereignty, is most often
                    understood in legal terms, but this approach runs into problems. Byrd and Hruschka argue the
                    sovereign is “‘higher’ than both the highest executive and the highest judge and thus stands
                    <i>above</i> them, because the second and third powers are <i>subject to</i>, or
                    <i>under</i> the law”.<sup><a href="#Fn70"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>70</a></sup> This is true, but it does not seem to me to account for the
                    features of the hierarchy as just described. The fact that executive and judicial authority
                    must be exercised in accordance with law seems to be more of an expression of the separation
                    of authorities with regard to law-making than an account of the hierarchy. The subordination
                    of the regent and judge to law is perfectly compatible with the three authorities being
                    ‘coordinate and subordinate’.<sup><a href="#Fn71"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>71</a></sup> That describes the separation of authority with regard to
                    law-making, rather than the hierarchy of authorities. Indeed, in the passage cited by Byrd
                    and Hruschka in support of this understanding of the hierarchy, Kant does say ‘the regent is
                    subject to the law’.<sup><a href="#Fn72"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>72</a></sup> However, he also says ‘The sovereign can <i>also</i> take the
                    ruler’s authority away’ indicating that the authority of the sovereign over the regent
                    consists in more than the subordination of executive authority to law.<sup><a href="#Fn73"><span
                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>73</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>Ripstein also argues that ‘the legislative will takes priority’ because ‘the exercise of
                    judgment and the enforcement of rights’ by the judge and regent respectively ‘must be done
                    in accordance with law’.<sup><a href="#Fn74"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>74</a></sup> But he goes further to argue that ‘The only way a judge or
                    enforcer can be empowered consistent with right is through an act of legislative
                    will’.<sup><a href="#Fn75"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>75</a></sup> This
                    is suggestive that not only is the sovereign higher because the powers of the regent and
                    judge must be exercised under law, but the hierarchy also consists in the power of the
                    sovereign to appoint the regent and the judge through legal means. This, I think, does
                    address the hierarchy of authorities, because these powers of appointment are not
                    reciprocal. This idea is expanded by Marie Newhouse who argues ‘the legislative authority is
                    first among equals’ because it has ‘the capacity to make constitutional laws that allocate
                    authorities among institutions within the empirical state’.<sup><a href="#Fn76"><span
                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>76</a></sup> However, the legalistic
                    understanding of the hierarchy still faces problems. One is that it makes it hard to
                    understand how the sovereign’s judgment in the population-wide murder conspiracy case can be
                    rightful. Recall that the sovereign does not act through ‘public law’ and, indeed, acts
                    contrary to established positive legislation.<sup><a href="#Fn77"><span
                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>77</a></sup> The same problem applies
                    at least to the case of forced levies which deviate ‘from previously existing law’.<sup><a
                            href="#Fn78"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>78</a></sup> Whilst it
                    might be possible to understand the sovereign’s powers of appointment in legal terms, if one
                    is available, an understanding of the hierarchy that can explain all its facets together is
                    preferable.</p>
                <p>A second problem with understanding the hierarchy as an assertion of the legal supremacy of
                    the sovereign over the regent and judge is it causes one to wonder in what sense a
                    separation of authorities really obtains at all. In his analysis, Guyer argues that the
                    hierarchy of authorities overrides any claim Kant might have to a separation of authorities.
                    Relying on a similarly legal understand of the hierarchy, Guyer presents us with a useful
                    challenge.<sup><a href="#Fn79"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>79</a></sup>
                    Guyer claims ‘there is no clear sense in which the legislature is ever <i>subordinate</i> to
                    the executive’ and ‘As long as the entire judicial process – finding of fact, application of
                    law, enforcement of law – is governed by the laws of the legislature, the authorities
                    involved in the judicial process remain subordinate to the legislature. There is no obvious
                    sense in which the judiciary is coordinate to the legislature’.<sup><a href="#Fn80"><span
                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>80</a></sup> Hence, Kant’s claim that
                    the three authorities are coordinate and subordinate to each other is a ‘rhetorical
                    flourish’.<sup><a href="#Fn81"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>81</a></sup>
                    Yet given that Kant’s coordinate and subordinate claim occurs within the main text of <i>The
                        Doctrine of Right</i>, hence as part of Kant’s system of right and not, for example, in
                    the remarks or in the preface, it would be surprising if the claim were entirely
                    rhetorical.<sup><a href="#Fn82"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>82</a></sup>
                    How, then, can we explain the hierarchy but not reduce Kant’s subordinate/coordinate claim –
                    and hence the separation of authorities – to mere rhetoric?</p>
                <p>The key, I believe, is the distinction between the two conceptions of sovereignty
                    distinguished in Section <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link"
                        data-track-action="section anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s10982-023-09486-w#Sec3">II</a>.
                    Over the previous two sections,
                    we have been looking closely at Kant’s conception of sovereignty as legislature. We have
                    seen that this sovereign is embedded in complex relations with the regent and the judge with
                    the purposes of establishing rightful law and ensuring the sovereign has the authority to
                    maintain the state. I now want to bring the conception of sovereignty as public authority
                    into the discussion. Recall that on this conception all the authorities and all the
                    authority of the state adhere to the sovereign. What we can now see is that there is a
                    certain fuzziness to the conception of sovereignty as legislature that blurs the distinction
                    with the conception of sovereign as public authority. The sovereign legislature does not
                    hold all authority in the state, but it does hold some authority over all other authorities
                    in the state. In other words, Kant’s sovereign legislature does not hold all state
                    authority, but is not simply one authority among three either.</p>
                <p>Narrowing the gap between two conceptions of an ambiguous concept is not to eliminate the
                    ambiguity, but in this case it does help us understand it. I suggest that the best way of
                    understanding this ambiguity is not as a failure of precise definition of a legal concept,
                    but as the use in practical reasoning of a political concept – hence I call this
                    interpretation <i>the political conception of sovereignty</i>. According to this reading,
                    the sovereign in the Kantian state holds all the authority of the state. However, they are
                    also under an obligation to alienate their authority over judicial and executive matters
                    onto other persons. The regent and the judge hold and enact the authority of the sovereign
                    in executive and legislative matters. This is what I take Kant to mean when he describes the
                    regent as an ‘<i>agent</i> of the state’ or the ‘organ of the sovereign’.<sup><a href="#Fn83"><span
                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>83</a></sup> The
                    authority of the regent and the judge is ultimately the sovereign’s but ought to be actioned
                    by different persons. This also means that in cases such as the population-wide murder
                    conspiracy and the others discussed above, the sovereign has the authority and right to
                    intervene on the executive and judge in their functions because the sovereign is only
                    interfering with rights to executive and judicial authority that they already hold.</p>
                <p>On the political conception of sovereignty, both the conception as legislature and the
                    conception as public authority hold it certain respects. The sovereign is regarded as
                    holding all public authority but is also regarded as obligated to rule as a sovereign
                    legislature. Rightful law is established through a separation of authorities, and so the
                    sovereign is obligated to alienate executive and judicial authority onto other persons in
                    order to rule rightfully. In contrast to Guyer’s claim, then, there is a sense in which the
                    regent subordinates the sovereign. The sovereign is ideally subordinate to the regent and
                    the judge with regard to their functions in law-making. Kant’s claim that the three
                    authorities are coordinate and subordinate to each other thus holds in the form of an
                    imperative on the sovereign. Given that the separation of authorities comprises part of the
                    ideal state in idea, this imperative structure of the claim is not out of place.</p>
                <p>However, as we have seen, under some empirical circumstances maintaining or attaining such a
                    separation of authority becomes impossible without thereby imperilling the state upon the
                    existence of which the possibility of rightful law depends. So, the sovereign is also under
                    another obligation to maintain the state. These two obligations are not inherently
                    contradictory but can become so under certain empirical circumstances. Kant’s ambiguous and
                    political conception of sovereignty seems to leave us with a threat of contradiction, but it
                    is here that the role of political judgment emerges most clearly, and most decisively.
                    Kant’s sovereign is ambiguous because they are active in the politics of the state, not a
                    static legal institution which frames political life. The sovereign is tasked with judging
                    when the empirical circumstances permit rule through rightful law, and when they require the
                    sovereign to exercise their extra-legal authority. Once we understand this extra-legal or
                    political quality of Kant’s sovereign, we can also see how the sovereign’s judgment in the
                    population-wide murder conspiracy case can be understood as rightful, and do so in a way
                    consistent with other instances where the hierarchy is either expressed or invoked in <i>The
                        Doctrine of Right</i>. This gives us reason to favour a political over a legal reading
                    of Kant’s conception of sovereignty.</p>
                <p>As an example of political sovereignty in action, consider the right to punish. This is a
                    coercive right, and as such a right of executive authority.<sup><a href="#Fn84"><span
                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>84</a></sup> What the political
                    conception implies is that the right to punish is a right of the sovereign, because all
                    rights of the state ultimately adhere to the sovereign. However, given the obligation to
                    establish rightful law and hence to rule through a separation of authorities, the exercise
                    of this authority ought to be carried out by the regent. The sovereign then rules rightfully
                    as a sovereign legislature without executive or judicial functions. This is ‘to make the
                    <i>kind of government</i> suited to the idea of the original contract’ or, as Kant would put
                    it elsewhere, to rule in ‘the spirit of a representative system’ or in a republican ‘manner
                    of governing’.<sup><a href="#Fn85"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>85</a></sup> Fulfilling this obligation may require reforms of the state,
                    which Kant holds must ‘be carried out only through <i>reform</i> by the sovereign
                    itself…’<sup><a href="#Fn86"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>86</a></sup>
                    The sovereign is required to judge when doing so is compatible with the ongoing existence of
                    the state. However, even once this step to separate authority is taken, the sovereign cannot
                    absolve themselves from affairs of state other than giving law. Recall the previously
                    discussed right of the sovereign to depose the regent if the regent becomes a threat to the
                    state. It is easy to imagine how a rogue regent with the right to punish through the
                    exercise of coercion might be such a threat and why Kant would want the sovereign to act
                    against them by deposing them. According to the political conception of sovereignty, the
                    political judgment as to when this is necessary falls to the sovereign.
                </p>
                <p>What is interesting about this is that it allows a certain flexibility for the sovereign to
                    approximate as closely as possible to rightful rule, even in circumstances which make this
                    very difficult. Kant is very hesitant about allowing the sovereign to exercise executive
                    authority under any circumstances. He writes ‘In that case the sovereign behaves through its
                    minister as also the regent and so as a despot’.<sup><a href="#Fn87"><span
                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>87</a></sup> He is also concerned that
                    any form of coercive resistance to the regent would be self-contradictory as the executive
                    authority is the supreme coercive authority. If another authority could resist them, they
                    would no longer be supreme. But the sovereign still has a course of action open to them
                    which they can take if they judge it necessary to maintain the state. They can strip the
                    regent of executive authority and appoint another in their place. The previous regent would
                    then return to being only a private citizen. Were they to continue to try to exercise
                    coercion this would be a clear wrong, and the new regent would be acting rightfully in
                    coercively putting down what now could only be described as a rebellion. These are the kind
                    of fine political judgments that the political sovereign is tasked with whether or not a
                    separation of authorities has already been established. The challenge for the sovereign is
                    to come as close to rightful ruling as the circumstances allow, which may even involve
                    backwards steps if the circumstances demand it.<sup><a href="#Fn88"><span

                Political Judgment and the Ideal Legal System</h2>
            <div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec11-content">
                <p>Once we have the <i>political</i> quality of Kant’s concept of sovereignty in view, the
                    ambiguity in sovereignty eventually resolves into a contradiction between two obligations on
                    the sovereign, which is itself resolved through the political judgment of the sovereign. One
                    might say that this amounts to clearing up the ambiguity and restoring consistency to Kant.
                    In one sense, this is correct. In so far as Kant’s political philosophy should enable us to
                    make consistent political judgments, the ambiguity is not problematic. But if the text is
                    supposed to be the blueprint for an ideal legal state or system of law as Kantian legalists
                    would have it, then the ambiguity still presents a problem. Kant does not define the
                    circumstances in which sovereign judgment may subordinate the ordinary processes of rightful
                    law and the separation of authorities, he leaves it to the judgment of the sovereign. We
                    might be able to say that if the sovereign is wrong about whether there is a threat to the
                    state, then they have exercised judgment poorly. We might also be able to say that if the
                    sovereign is not acting in good faith and is using the threat to the state as a pretext for
                    usurping other authorities, then this is wrong. But in both cases, what we don’t have is a
                    set of conditions and circumstances by which the rightfulness is to be judged without either
                    relying on empirical judgment about how bad a threat to the state is, or on suppositions
                    about what the sovereign is really thinking.</p>
                <p>Kantian legalism favours a discourse of legal precision, set categories, and fine
                    distinctions, and I suspect would reject this tolerance of the ambiguity inherent in
                    political sovereignty.<sup><a href="#Fn89"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>89</a></sup> More importantly, however, the interpretation I have given
                    suggests that Kant’s political principles are principles of political judgment, not
                    principles of ideal legal systems or even of legal judgments. This is the core of my
                    challenge to Kantian legalism. Whilst it would be wrong to say of <i>The Doctrine of
                        Right</i>, and Kant’s political philosophy in general, that it is not concerned with the
                    elaboration and justification of a system of <i>a priori</i> legal principles which are to
                    serve as the normative ideal for all positive legal systems, my point is that it is
                    concerned with much more besides. <i>The Doctrine of Right</i> is a system of external
                    duties that concern interaction between agents from which all rights derive.<sup><a
                            href="#Fn90"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>90</a></sup> Such
                    external duties are not exhausted by those <i>a priori</i> legal principles that ground a
                    system of law but concern all external duties including those that cannot be captured within
                    a legal system. This renders <i>The Doctrine of Right</i> an inherently <i>political</i>
                    text; it aims to orientate the agent in a world shared with others by establishing grounds
                    for external duties and principles for practical judgment.<sup><a href="#Fn91"><span
                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>91</a></sup><i>The Doctrine of
                        Right</i> is thus best understood as offering a sustained attempt at political and
                    practical reasoning of which the ambiguous concept of political sovereignty is, I suggest, a
                    key part. Kant’s aim is not legal precision, but principles that guide the judgment of
                    political agents. In Kant’s practical reasoning in <i>The Doctrine of Right</i> the
                    perspective of the finite, which is to say the human, judging agent is never lost. If
                    sovereignty is political, ambiguous, and active, rather than legal, precise, and static,
                    then it is not possible to eliminate judgment from our politics. Nor is it (always) possible
                    to constrain it through law. Judgment is needed at each stage of political thinking and
                    acting, never allowing us to rest assured that law grounded on <i>a priori</i> principles
                    justifies everything we do. The political sovereign is active within the Kantian state and
                    must exercise judgment in contending with all the vagaries of empirical political
                    circumstance.</p>
                <p>There are no explicit conditions that could frame a constitutional provision determining when
                    the sovereign exercises their judgment, because the framing of such an ideal constitution is
                    not Kant’s primary concern. Indeed, the means by which he could do this are ruled out. As we
                    have already seen, positive law (constitutional or otherwise) does not constrain the
                    sovereign’s judgment. Recall that Kant claims that the sovereign’s usurpation of the judge
                    in population-wide murder conspiracy case ‘cannot be done in accordance with public
                    law’.<sup><a href="#Fn92"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>92</a></sup> This
                    is an explicit statement that when the sovereign usurps the role of the judge, the sovereign
                    does not act through law by changing it or introducing a loophole. It is perhaps because
                    Kant invokes ‘justice, as the idea of judicial authority’ as the grounds for his policy of
                    an-eye-for-an-eye that such legal solutions are unacceptable in this case.<sup><a href="#Fn93"><span
                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>93</a></sup> This is
                    all the more likely if we also accept my earlier characterisation of this law of punishment
                    as objective law. Kant instead turns to a different solution, one that takes us beyond the
                    law, to a ‘Machtspruch’ or executive decree.<sup><a href="#Fn94"><span
                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>94</a></sup> As we saw in Section <a
                        data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="section anchor"
                        href="/article/10.1007/s10982-023-09486-w#Sec9">IV</a>, this also applies to other cases
                    in which Kant argues for the sovereign to act extra-legally in defence of the existence of
                    the state, such as that of forced loans, or in violation of the separation of authorities,
                    such as deposing the regent. We might add to this last point that Kant’s rejection of ‘mixed
                    constitutions’ and his claim that a ‘moderate constitution, as a constitution of the inner
                    rights of a state, is an absurdity’ show that he is also not concerned with other legal
                    institutions constraining the sovereign’s judgment.<sup><a href="#Fn95"><span
                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>95</a></sup> The other authorities do
                    not hold rightful authority over the sovereign and so cannot constrain the sovereign’s
                    judgment.</p>
                <p>The core difference between the&nbsp;reading of <i>The Doctrine of Right</i> presented here
                    and that of Kantian legalists, is the claim that Kant’s primary concern is not framing the
                    ideal constitution because his political principles are principles of political judgment not
                    of ideal legal systems. I am not arguing that an ideal legal system is unimportant for Kant.
                    Indeed, the necessity of creating and maintaining a system of law is Kant’s justification
                    for the separation of authorities. Moreover, I also accept that ideals play a key role in
                    Kant’s political philosophy. Nor am I claiming that Kantian legalism sees no place for
                    political judgment.<sup><a href="#Fn96"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>96</a></sup> Instead, I am making a claim about the relationship of this
                    ideal of a legal system to political judgment. For Kantian legalists, political judgment is
                    legal in the sense that it is constrained within the established legal order. State
                    authorities are empowered by law to make judgments that would otherwise be wrongful. This
                    leaves open the matter of the political judgments reached by different state authorities,
                    but it requires that these judgments be grounded in law or given expression through law. It
                    is this understanding of political judgment in Kant that I reject. Political judgment in
                    Kant is not constrained by the ideal legal system, but rather the latter depends on the
                    former. The sovereign’s judgment is political.<sup><a href="#Fn97"><span
                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>97</a></sup> It is, as Kant terms it
                    in the population-wide murder conspiracy example, a ‘Machtspruch’. It is an exercise of
                    power, unconstrained by law upon which the possibility of the legal system and of rightful
                    law-making depends.</p>
                <p>Kant’s ideal legal system or the ideal ‘state in idea’ is then a regulative ideal that
                    orientates for the sake of practical action.<sup><a href="#Fn98"><span
                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>98</a></sup> Ideals in Kant’s
                    practical philosophy are the realisation of ideas of reason. A useful example of what this
                    means can be found the <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i> where Kant says that the idea of
                    wisdom has as its counterpart ideal the perfectly wise person or sage.<sup><a href="#Fn99"><span
                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>99</a></sup> An ideal
                    is an individual thing entirely determined by the idea. Whether this is the ideal sage by
                    the idea of wisdom, or the ideal legal system by the idea of rightful law. Such ideals are
                    impossible for us to realise, but they serve to orientate the action of practical moral
                    agents.<sup><a href="#Fn100"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>100</a></sup>
                    Thus in so far as wisdom is a virtue, we ought to strive to realise sagacity in our own
                    person, even though being perfectly wise is impossible. The same is true of Kant’s ideal
                    legal system in so far as the sovereign ought to rule through rightful law, with the
                    attendant separation of authorities, so they are constrained by the idea of law in the form
                    of an obligation. But for this argument to support a legalistic constraint on judgment it
                    would require that this idea of law must be decisive in the sovereign’s judgment. Political
                    judgment must be made the mere application of the idea of law to empirical circumstances.
                </p>
                <p>However, we have already seen that the sovereign is also under an obligation to maintain the
                    state. Moreover, we have seen that this obligation is grounded in Kant’s ideal ‘state in
                    idea’. The ideal is thus complex and arises from to two imperatives, both binding on the
                    sovereign, that are not inherently contradictory but might become so under particular
                    empirical circumstances. Put another way, the sovereign is stuck between two orientations.
                    Again, think of the population-wide murder conspiracy. It is only under the empirical
                    circumstances in which there is such an enormous conspiracy that the sovereign is forced
                    into a judgment between two obligations. The first is to allow the verdict to go ahead in
                    accordance with objectively rightful law, the second is to usurp the function of the judge
                    in order to maintain the state. Faced with this dilemma, the <i>a priori</i> idea of
                    rightful law cannot be decisive in the sovereign’s judgment since there is nothing <i>a
                        priori</i> that allows for a judgment between the two obligations.</p>
                <p>This dilemma is a conflict of duties. Strictly speaking, Kant denies that a true conflict of
                    duties is possible, but in the introduction to <i>The Metaphysics of Morals</i> he discusses
                    the potential for conflicts in what he calls the grounds of obligation.<sup><a href="#Fn101"><span
                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>101</a></sup>
                    Following Jens Timmermann’s analysis, such grounds of obligation are best conceived of as
                    pro tanto duties which can be defeated by other grounds of obligation judged to be
                    stronger.<sup><a href="#Fn102"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>102</a></sup>
                    To find the stronger ground of obligation, the judger cannot simply look to <i>a priori</i>
                    principles, but must judge according to the moral conditions of their experiential
                    circumstances. This is a moral judgment that can only be made by the judging agent in the
                    conditions they find themselves. The conflict ‘arises in moral practice’.<sup><a href="#Fn103"><span
                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>103</a></sup> Applying
                    this idea to the case of the sovereign exercising political judgment, the sovereign must
                    judge which of the grounds of obligation – the idea of rightful law, or the maintenance of
                    the state – is stronger in the circumstances of their moral practice. In this political
                    instance of a conflict of duties, the sovereign will have to make a kind of prudential
                    judgment: Will ruling rightfully, through the law and the separation of authorities,
                    threaten the state? In the case of the population-wide murder conspiracy the answer is
                    clear, it will do so and so the ground of obligation to maintain the state is stronger. In
                    other cases, the answer won’t be so clear, and the sovereign may have to accept some risk to
                    the state in order to rule rightfully.</p>
                <p>The ideal legal state thus cannot provide definitive orientation to political judgment, and
                    nor can the idea of law itself be decisive. Kant’s ideal for the legal state is part of his
                    practical reasoning in <i>The Doctrine of Right</i>, but it is not his only focus. His focus
                    is on the rightfulness of political judgment, and the principles that guide it. He finds
                    that the application of law, and the formulation of a legal ideal is not sufficient for this
                    task. The picture of moral and political judgment that emerges in Kant is a good deal more
                    complicated than that.</p>

                <p>Kant’s political sovereign carries a heavy burden of responsibility.<sup><a href="#Fn104"><span
                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>104</a></sup> They are
                    bound to make political judgments, but neither <i>a priori</i> principles, nor regents,
                    judges, legal institutions nor positive law provide certain guidance. This is the limit of
                    law in Kant’s political philosophy: Law can never fully subordinate political judgment. In
                    this limit, Kant recognises that the force of empirical political circumstances on us finite
                    beings mandates that judgment is exercised at every step in politics. However, he also holds
                    that this judgment has a moral quality and a moral force. Prudent judgment is grounded not
                    in instrumental reasoning, but in the obligation to maintain the state. Kant morally
                    vindicates the role of prudence at the heart of his politics; exercised in accordance with
                    rightful principle, prudence is not amoral or immoral, but is, to the contrary, deeply
                    moral. This is what he means when he claims that a moral politician is ‘one who takes the
                    principles of political prudence in such a way that they can coexist with morals’.<sup><a
                            href="#Fn105"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>105</a></sup> Rightful
                    political judgment requires the sovereign as a moral politician to exercise political
                    judgment to navigate the twin obligations to rule through rightful law-making and to
                    maintain the necessity of the state. To emphasise the role of political judgment in Kant’s
                    politics is not to dismiss the importance of moral judgment. It is rather to argue that
                    there is a form of moral judgment distinctive to politics, and that the responsibility for
                    this judgment falls on the sovereign above all.<sup><a href="#Fn106"><span
                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>106</a></sup></p>
                <p>To conclude this paper, I want to set out where my arguments leave me in relation to Kantian
                    legalism and to the literature on Kant’s political philosophy more broadly. The active,
                    political, prudential and judging Kantian sovereign I have argued for is in stark contrast
                    to any legalist reading of the concept. As an interpretation of the ambiguity inherent in
                    the notion of sovereignty, the political conception emphasises that, for Kant, establishing,
                    maintaining and improving a rightful constitution in the world is not a legal project but a
                    political one.<sup><a href="#Fn107"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>107</a></sup><i>The Doctrine of Right</i> is the key text for understanding
                    how he understands right and law and, in the central concept of sovereignty, Kant grounds
                    law on the political judgment of the sovereign. Political judgment is thus central to <i>The
                        Doctrine of Right</i>, not the marginal concern it often appears to be in Kantian
                    legalism.</p>
                <p>As well as this difference with Kantian legalism, my view also contrasts with approaches to
                    political judgment in Kant which follow Hannah Arendt in drawing on material from Kant’s
                    <i>Critique of the Power of Judgment</i>, and as well as from other of Kant’s political,
                    anthological, or historical writings.<sup><a href="#Fn108"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>108</a></sup> A full picture of the
                    role of political judgment in Kant’s political philosophy might well require these kinds of
                    accounts. But my purpose here, and my challenge against the Kantian legalist, is to show
                    that the principles derived in <i>The Doctrine of Right</i> itself, are principles of
                    political judgment, not only of legal systems. It is not only in his historical,
                    anthropological, and pedagogical writings, and well as other texts on politics, that
                    judgment is key for Kant. Though these writings may take up the question of the refinement
                    of political judgment, it is in <i>The Doctrine of Right</i> that the central importance of
                    political judgment is established. By contrast with Arendt who declared Kant never wrote a
                    political philosophy – a point Ronald Beiner refined by saying that, since Kant supposedly
                    sees no place for prudence, he has no account of political judgment<sup><a href="#Fn109"><span
                                class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>109</a></sup> – for
                    Kant, as I read him, political judgment determines the relationship of law and politics. My
                    claim thus does not amount to the well-established understanding that Kant thought that
                    moral principles, such as those found in <i>The Doctrine of Right</i>, require
                    supplementation by judgment, something that Kantian legalists are as clear about as any
                    other group of interpreters.<sup><a href="#Fn110"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote
                            </span>110</a></sup> Rather my claim is that the moral principles of <i>The Doctrine
                        of Right</i> should be understood as apt for judgment. That is, as principles of
                    political judgment.
                </p>
                <p>Kant’s complex ideal of the ‘state in idea’ or <i>Rechtsstaat</i> arises from two
                    obligations, to rule rightfully through law and to maintain the state, which can become
                    contradictory under certain empirical circumstances. Whilst a legalist reading would attempt
                    to resolve such a possible contradiction through the precise delineation of principles in
                    philosophy, I have argued that Kant held that for this task the sovereign’s practical
                    political judgment is central. Thus, contrary to Kantian legalism, politics is not
                    subordinated to law, rather law depends on political judgment. The task of politics is not
                    only to apply law in particular circumstances; the task of politics judge what is necessary
                    to secure the conditions in which a legal system, grounded on <i>a priori</i> principles,
                    could exist.</p>
                <p>As Kant puts it in his reply to criticism from Benjamin Constant, politics is a problem, the
                    problem of how to arrange society in accordance with freedom and equality.<sup><a
                            href="#Fn111"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>111</a></sup> It is a
                    problem finite human beings face, perhaps perpetually, and that requires judgment, not only
                    law and principles, to manage successfully. It is this thought of Kant’s, though not
                    necessarily ‘Kantian’ thought, that I have tried to understand in this paper, a task which
                    legalistic readings have not undertaken. I don’t claim to have decisively refuted such
                    readings, only suggested that another kind of interpretation is possible, one embraces the
                    active ambiguity in Kant’s conception of sovereignty as being the result of the practical
                    and political perspective from which he wrote and judged.</p>

                            the obligation of the ‘Konstituierenden Gewalt’, the constituting authority, to

                        <p>There is some debate as to whether the Kant’s term <i>Gewalten</i> should be
                            translated as ‘authorities’ or ‘powers’. As Paul Guyer points out, ‘powers’ would be
                            the usual translation, though Mary Gregor’s standard English translation of <i>The
                                Metaphysics of Morals</i> also uses ‘authorities’. I use ‘authorities’ here to
                            emphasise the moral and normative quality of Kant’s use of the term. This is also
                            the translation used by Kantian legalists for the most part. As Guyer also points
                            out, use of one English term for each German term is preferable, so I stick to the
                            use of ‘authorities’ throughout. See Paul Guyer, ‘Achenwall, Kant, and The Division

                            sovereign (legislative) and executive authorities. Gregor uses the same term ‘ruler’
                            to translate terms connected with sovereign (legislative) authority (‘herrscher’ and
                            ‘beherrscher’) and those connected with executive authority (‘regierers’ and
                            ‘Regent’). I amend Gregor’s translation accordingly and use ‘regent’ to refer to the

                        <p><i>MM</i> 6:316–317. When referring to authorities by pronoun I use ‘they’ to account
                            for moral personality of authorities (see <i>MM</i> 6:316) which could involve more
                            than one physical, or natural, person. For example, an executive government, a
                            sovereign aristocratic or democratic assembly, or a court. I note this because of
                            the difficulties and tensions in the gendering of Kant’s political philosophy. See

                            a moral but not natural person (see above, fn. 20). Kant’s use of autocrat, as
                            opposed to monarch, reflects his hostility to hereditary succession. On this see
                            Helga Varden, ‘Self-Governance and Reform in Kant’s Liberal Republicanism – Ideal
                            and Non-Ideal Theory in Kant’s Doctrine of Right’. <i>Doispontos</i> 13 (2) (2016):
                            pp. 39–70. I take it from Kant’s claim that reform of the state cannot include
                            reform of the sovereign itself from one of the three forms into another’ that the
                            sovereign can take on a non-democratic form permanently, see 6:338–340. This is a
                            contested view. For opposing views, see Byrd &amp; Hruschka, <i>Commentary</i>, p.
                            181 and Paul Guyer, “‘Hobbes Is of the Opposite Opinion’ Kant and Hobbes on the
                            Three Authorities in the State”. <i>Hobbes Studies</i> 25 (2012): pp. 91–119, p.
                            114. The arguments of this paper do not depend on one’s views of Kant’s endorsement
                            or not of democracy. They apply to any morally legitimate form of sovereignty, be
                            that autocratic, aristocratic or democratic, or only democratic. Cf. <i>F</i>

                            consequential (see fn. 34). Kant holds that civil offices (including, not
                            incidentally, university professors) cannot be removed by the sovereign except in
                            the case of a crime being committed, whilst dignities can. Even then, unless a crime
                            has been committed, the person will still be left with the dignity of citizenship,

                            (as I argue in Section <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link"
                                data-track-action="section anchor"
                                href="/article/10.1007/s10982-023-09486-w#Sec10">V</a>), undergirds law and that
                            it can overturn it is especially uncomfortable for Kantian legalists, just as
                            Schmitt’s account of ‘the exception’ was abhorred by the neo-Kantian legalist Hans
                            Kelsen. However, there are clear differences between Schmitt and Kant. The most
                            important is that Kant gives moral justifications for when the sovereign should
                            exercise their authority. For a traditional analysis of the differences between
                            Schmitt and Kant, see Seyla Benhabib, ‘Carl Schmitt’s Critique of Kant: Sovereignty
                            and International Law’, <i>Political Theory</i>, 40 (6) (2012): pp. 688–713. For an
                            analysis closer to the spirit of the interpretation of Kant offered in this paper,

                            executive is <i>de facto</i> sovereign over the legislature although the latter is
                            <i>de jure</i> sovereign. If I understand Guyer correctly, his claim that Kant’s
                            coordinate and subordinate claim is a rhetorical flourish would only apply to the
                            <i>de jure</i> allocation of sovereignty. As my concern here is Kant’s moral and
                            political conception of sovereignty, it is who is sovereign <i>de jure</i> which
                            counts for my argument. See Paul Guyer, ‘Is Sovereignty Divided Still Sovereignty?

                        <p><i>MM</i> 6:322. In the same passage, Kant limits reforms to the executive authority,
                            and not the sovereign itself. We can infer that, as citizens are prohibited from
                            attempting to reform through revolution and overthrowing the sovereign, since this
                            would amount to ‘abolishing the entire legal constitution’ and ‘destroying the
                            fatherland’, so too the sovereign may not reform themselves, for example by
                            transitioning from an aristocracy to a democracy. If they did, they would no longer
                            be sovereign and so would have destroyed the state, see <i>MM</i> 6:320; <i>MM</i>
                            6:340. Perhaps because of this Kant also holds at <i>MM</i> 6:342: ‘The right of
                            supreme legislation in a commonwealth is not an alienable right, but the most
                            personal of all rights’. Self-reform would alienate the sovereign’s right which they
                            have no right to alienate.</p>

                            Though ‘the political’ is notoriously hard to define, I hope that the contrast to
                            ‘the legal’ is sufficiently clear in the context of this paper. For avoidance of
                            doubt, I do not suggest Kant affirmed any hard distinction between ‘the political’

                        <p>This is not quite accurate as Kant seems to hold that ideals are realisable in the
                            <i>noumenal</i> world beyond the <i>phenomenal</i> world of sense experience. Hence
                            in the <i>Critique of Practical Reason</i>, Kant argues that the highest good –
                            happiness in proportion to perfect virtue – is realisable only outside of the
                            phenomenal world characterised by space and time. For this reason, he endorses moral
                            beliefs in the immortal soul and God, see <i>CPrR,</i> 5:110 on the highest good.
                            These considerations take us far beyond the subject of this paper. For present
                            purposes, it is enough to say that ideals can orientate practical agents, even if
                            they are not realisable in this world. Jakob Huber has argued for the relevance of

                        <p>This invites a discussion of the debate over the relationship of morality and
                            politics in <i>The Doctrine of Right</i>, which for reasons of space I cannot
                            discuss at length. The debate concerns those who view <i>The Doctrine of Right</i>
                            as grounded on Kant’s fundamental moral principle ‘act on a maxim which can also
                            hold as a universal law’ (<i>MM</i> 6:226) such as Jürgen Habermas and Guyer; those
                            who view it as independent of it such as Allen Wood and Marcus Willaschek; and those
                            who hold positions in between these polls such as Ripstein, which we might call
                            ‘complex dependency’ views. In reality the substance of these positions constitute a
                            spectrum, rather than clearly delineated camps. For example, one might reasonably
                            disagree with my classification of Guyer under the dependency rather than complex
                            dependency view. In this debate, I find the complex dependency position most
                            convincing, and my arguments can be read in light of that. A full argument for this
                            position is well beyond the scope of the present paper. See Jürgen Habermas,
                            <i>Between Facts and Norms</i>: Contributions to a Discourse Theory of Law and
                            Democracy (Cambridge: Polity Press, 1996) (Trans.) William Rehg, pp. 104–106;

                        <p>Putting the point this way might bring Christoph Horn’s <i>Nichtideale Normativität:
                                Ein neuer Blick auf Kants politische Philosophie</i> (Berlin: Suhrkamp, 2014) to
                            mind. There is much my account has in common with Horn’s, though naturally mine has
                            a narrower focus. The major difference, as I see it, is that I emphasise political
                            judgment rather than the non-ideal normativity that is the centre of Horn’s
                            interpretation.</p>

                        <p>A very good example of this is Miguel Vatter, ‘The People Shall Be Judge: Reflective
                            Judgment and Constituent Power in Kant’s Philosophy of Law’, <i>Political Theory</i>
                            39 (6) (2011): pp. 749–776. Whilst there is much I agree with in Vatter’s account,
                            for the purposes of this paper I cannot share his focus on reflecting judgment. In
                            the <i>Critique of the Power of Judgment</i>, Kant distinguishes two kinds of
                            judgment. Along with reflecting, there is also determining judgment. In the latter
                            the judgment takes the form of the application of a prior universal to a particular,
                            such as the application of a moral law. In the former, the universal to be applied
                            to the particular is found through judgment itself, and this characterises aesthetic
                            and teleological judgment. Whilst an account of reflecting judgment, especially as
                            concerns teleology, would be necessary for a full account of political judgment in
                            Kant, in the context of the practical, and hence, moral reasoning of <i>The Doctrine
                                of Right</i> specifically, it is determining judgment, the kind which
                            characterises moral judgment, that is crucial for understanding the deep
                            philosophical relationship between law, judgment and politics in Kant. See
                            <i>CPJ</i>, 20:221–226.

                            University of Chicago Press, 1983), p. 68. Arendt, as noted, went on to develop a
                            Kantian political philosophy out of Kant’s conception of aesthetic judgment
                            in&nbsp;the <i>Critique of The Power of Judgment</i>. Whilst this has been hugely
                            influential, and especially notable for me due to my focus on judgment, it is
                            <i>Arendt’s</i> account of political judgment. My focus here has been <i>Kant’s</i>
                            account in his political philosophy and how this relates to law.
